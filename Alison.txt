Verse 1:
(D)          G                            D           
Well it's so funny to be seeing you after so long girl
         G                              F#m           Bm     
With the way you look I understand that you are not impressed
      G                         F#m       Bm  
But I heard you let that little friend of mine
C                   Asus4-A
Took off your party dress

Pre-chorus:
G                    F#m      Bm    
I'm not going to get too sentimental
           G                 F#m   Bm
Like those other sticky valentines 
      G                         F#m         Bm  
Cos I don't know if you've been loving some body
C                    Asus4-A
I only know it isn't mine

Chorus:
G  D  
Alison
  G         A        F#m     Bm 
I know this world is killing you
   G  D  
Oh Alison
G  A      D   
My aim is true

Verse 2:
G                        D                    
... Well I see you got a husband now... did he
G                               F#m            Bm  
Leave your pretty fingers lying in the wedding cake
G                    F#m           Bm  
You used to hold him right in your hand
  C                        Asus4-A
I bet he took all he could take

Pre-chorus:
G                             F#m  pause     Bm     
Sometimes I wish that I could stop  you from talking
       G                              F#m Bm
When I hear the silly things that you say 
  G                         F#m         Bm   
I think somebody better put out the big light
      C                           Asus4-A
Cos I can't stand to see you this way

Chorus:
G  D  
Alison
  G         A        F#m     Bm 
I know this world is killing you
   G  D  
Oh Alison
G  A      D    G
My aim is true 

End:
G  A      D    G
My aim is true 
G  A      D    G
My aim is true 
G  A      D   
My aim is true
