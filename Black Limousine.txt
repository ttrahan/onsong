             C       
We used to ride, baby
                      G  
Ride around in limousines
              C        
We looked so fine, baby
                         G  
You in white and me in green
               C    
Drinking and dancing
                     G  
All inside a crazy dream
          D                        
Well now look at your face now baby
C                        G  D
 Look at you and look at me 


VERSE:
I get so scared
Just to see you on the street
They're living dead
You're all the same, you never speak
You're wrecked out now
Washed up high up on the beach
Well now look at your face now baby
Look at you and look at me
