When [D]in walked a man with a [D]gun in his hand 
he was [E]looking for you know [A]who. 

He said "[D]Hey there fellow with the [D]hair colored yellow, 
[G]  watcha tryin' to [E]prove?

I was [D]scared and fearing for my [D]life 
[A]shaking like a leaf on a [A]tree 
Cuz he was [D]lean and mean and [D]big and bad, Lord, 
[E]pointing that gun at [A]me 

I said "[D]wait a minute mister, I [D]didn't even kiss her, 
[G]   don't want no trouble with [E]you 
and I [D]know you don't owe me but I [D]wish you would let me 
[A]ask one favor from [D]you:

Say won't you [D]gimme three steps, gimme [D]three steps mister,

Oh, well the [D]crowd cleared away and I [D]began to pray 
and the [A]water fell on the [A]floor 
and I'm [D]telling you, son, it [D]ain't no fun, 
staring [E]straight down a forty-[A]four. 

Well, he [D]turned and screamed at Linda [D]Lou, 
and that's the [G]break I was looking [E]for 
and you could [D]hear me screaming a [D]mile away 
as I was [A]headed out toward the [D]door.
