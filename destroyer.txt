Verse 1:
Met a girl called Lola and I took her back to my place
Feelin' guilty, feelin' scared, hidden cameras everywhere
Stop! hold on. stay in control

Girl, I want, you here with me
But I'm really not as cool as I'd like to be

'Cause there's a red, under my bed
And there's a little yellow man in my head
And there's a true, blue, inside of me

That keeps stoppin' me, touchin' ya, watchin' ya, lovin' ya


Chorus 1:
Paranoia, the destroyer
Paranoia, the destroyer


Verse 2:
Well I fell asleep, then I woke feelin' kinda' queer
Lola looked at me and said ooh you look so weird

She said man, there's really something wrong with you
One day you're gonna' self-destruct

You're up, get down, I'll come work you out
You get a good thing goin' then you blow yourself out


Chorus 2:
Silly boy, you self-destroyer
Silly boy, you self-destroyer
Silly boy, you got so much to live for
So much to aim for, so much to try for
You blow it all with paranoia
You're so insecure, you self-destroyer

And it goes like this, here it goes...
Paranoia, the destroyer

Here it goes again...
Paranoia, the destroyer


Verse 3:
Doctor, doctor, help me please I know you'll understand
There's a time device inside of me I'm a self-destructin' man
There's a red, under my bed
And there's a little green man in my head
And said you're not goin' crazy, you're just a bit sad
'Cause there's a man in ya, gnawin' ya, tearin' ya, in to to


Chorus 3:
Silly boy you self-destroyer
Paranoia, the destroyer
Self-destroyer, wreck your health
Destroy your friends, destroy yourself
The time device of self-destruction
Lies, confusion, start eruption

Yeah, and it goes like this, here it goes...
Paranoia, the destoyer
Here's to paranoia...
Paranoia, the destoyer
Hey hey, here it goes
Paranoia, the destoyer
And it goes like this

Paranoia, the destoyer
And it goes like this
