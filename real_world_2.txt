Well I wonder what it's like to be a rainmaker
I wonder what it's like to know that I made the rain
I'd store it in boxes with little yellow tags on every one
You can come and see them when I'm done, when I'm done

Boy I bet my friends will all be stunned, they're stunned

Strange, where were you, when we started this gig
I wish the real world would just stop hassling me

I wonder what it's like to be the head honcho
I wonder what I'd do if they all did just what I said
I'd shout out an order, I think we're out of this man get me some
Boy don't make me wanna change my tone, my tone

Straight up, what did you hope to learn about here
If I was someone else, would this all fall apart

Bridge:
[G]Please don't [Bb]change, please don't [Gm]break

Please don't [Bb]change, at all, for [Eb]me to [F]you
And [Eb]you, to [F]me

I wish the real world would just stop hassling me
I wish the real world would just stop hassling me
