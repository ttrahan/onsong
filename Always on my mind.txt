Verse 1:
C              G/B     
Maybe I didn't love you
Am       C          F          G
Quite as often as I could have 
C              G/B      
Maybe I didn't treat you
Am       C         Dm7          
Quite as good as I should have

Chorus:

Girl I'm sorry I was blind 
G            Am     F     C

All those lonely, lonely times
