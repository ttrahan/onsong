Lonely Road
Key: A
Capo 2

Intro:
[A] [E] [D]

Verse 1:
It was just this [A]lonely road
I was [E]driftin’ on
Far from [D]Home
It felt like some [A]sacred space
And I was [E]out there
All [D]alone
I hadn’t seen [A]another soul 
For a [E]mile or two
Maybe [D]more
I was just [A]lost in my thoughts
Feeling [E]better now
Than [D]before

Chorus:
And [E]now I see the [A]truth
From where I [D]stand
And [E]now I know [A]exactly
Just who I [D]am
Like [E]water in a river
Heads out to [D]sea
No [E]matter where I [A]go
There I'll [D]be

Verse 2:
It was just this [A]lonely road
I was [E]driftin’ on
Far from [D]Home
And I could see no [A]end in sight
But [E]knew just 
where to [D]go
I hadn’t heard [A]another soul 
For a [E]mile or two
Not a [D]sound
It quieted my [A]spirit
And kept my feet [E]planted
On the [D]ground

Chorus:
And [E]now I see the [A]truth
From where I [D]stand
And [E]now I know [A]exactly
Just who I [D]am
Like [E]water in a river
Heads out to [D]sea
No [E]matter where I [A]go
There I'll [D]be

Outro:
Yeah life can be a [A]long road
That you [E]travel
on your [D]own
It can be a [A]lonely road
But you [E]never
Travel it all [D]alone... [A]
