[E] [B] [F#m] [A]

And [E]I... 
Run around in [B]circles
Crash into what[F#m]ever
I might [A]find
and [E]You... 
tell me not to [B]worry
tell me [F#m]baby
you'll lose your [A]mi-ind

Chorus:
But [E]I just crash into [B]everything
And [E]like the flaws in a [A]diamond ring
That [E]can’t be seen with the [B]naked eye
Yet [A]still there to be [B]magnified
I [E]just crash into [B]everything
And [E]I just crash all [A]of the time
Laugh it off, say it’s [B]all just fine

Verse 2:
And I...
Feel like turning back
I want to run straight home
Into you
And throw
My cautions to the wind
Baby help me 
Make it through

But [E]I just crash into everything
And [B]like the flaws in a diamond ring

And [B]I just crash all of the time
[A]Laugh it off, say it’s all just [B]fine

Verse 3:
And we...
Are on this journey/flight
To wherever 
We might land
And I...
Feel a little nervous
That baby I
Might just crash again

Chorus:
Because I just crash into everything
And like the flaws in a diamond ring
That can’t be seen with the naked eye
Yet still there to be magnified
I just crash into everything
And I just crash all of the time
Laugh it off, say it’s all just fine
Yeah laugh it off...
It's all just fine...
