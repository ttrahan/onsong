Look Away
Key: D
Capo: 2

Verse 1:
[D]I felt that you weren't listening [Bm]much
To the words that I had [G]said
[D]I have all these dreams and [Bm]thoughts 
Swirling around/in my [F#m]head
About you and me and all
The promises we had made
And now it feels they were all
Just some kind of game

Chorus:
The [A]days they came
And [Bm]then they went 
And [G]before too long
How [D]easy we’d forget
The [A]story was 
Be[Bm]coming set
And now [G]alllll we can doooo
Is look [A]away

Verse 2:
I felt that I wasn’t seeing clearly
Like I did once before
And now the story ends
Hidden behind closed doors
About you and me and all
The games that were played
Young and foolish hearts
With all their youthful ways

Bridge: 
[E]Follow me to the edges of [B]time
Stand beneath the [G#m]stars at [A]night
[E]Try to recall the way things [B]were
When we were just [G#m]holding [A]tight 

Chorus:
The [A]days they came
And [Bm]then they went 
And [G]before too long
How [D]easy we’d forget
The [A]story was 
Be[Bm]coming set
And now [G]alllll we can doooo
Is look [A]away
