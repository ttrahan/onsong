[A]Up with the [E]sun work until it’s [F#m]gone

Verse 2:
Up again, it’s just another day
Work at your job so they can just play
Their silly games that seal your fate
And all the dreams they lay to waste

And you will never know peace
Until you bite the hand that feeds
Until you find a heart that bleeds
Until you burn out all the weeds
You will never know peace
You will never know peace

Verse 3:
Bottle your anger and put it on a shelf
Don’t worry too much to take care of yourself
Your broken body but with a sharpened mind
Spend all your money to buy a little more time

Chorus: 
And you will never know peace
Until you bite the hand that feeds
Until you find a heart that bleeds
Until you burn out all the weeds
You will never know peace
You will never know peace

Outro:
You will never know peace
You will never know peace
