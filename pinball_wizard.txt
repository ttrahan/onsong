Bsus4   B   x4
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
     Bsus4                      B
Ever since I was a young boy, I played the silver ball
     Asus4                    A
From Soho down to Brighton, I must have played 'em all
      Gsus4                           G
But I ain't seen nothin' like him, in any amusement hall
     F#sus4                    F# N.C.
That deaf, dumb and blind kid, sure plays a mean pinball
 
 
[Instrumental/Chorus]
 
B* B*  A*  D*  E E       x2
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
   Bsus4                         B
He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine
Asus4                    A
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean
   Gsus4                   G
He plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
     F#sus4                    F# N.C.
That deaf, dumb and blind kid, sure plays a mean pinball
 
 
[Instrumental/Chorus]
 
B* B*  A*  D*  E E       x2
 
 
[Bridge]
 
       E  F#*  B*
He's a pinball wizard
      E      F#*  B*
There has to be a twist
  E  F#*  B*
A pinball wizard
         G*            D* Dsus4* D*
He's got such a supple wrist
 
D*          Cadd9    G*
How do you think he does it? (I don't know)
D*         Cadd9  G*
What makes him so good?
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
Bsus4                            B
Ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzers and bells
      Asus4                        A
Don't see no lights a-flashin', he plays by sense of smell
Gsus4                   G
Always gets the replay, never seen him fall
     F#sus4                    F# N.C.
That deaf, dumb and blind kid, sure plays a mean pinball
 
 
[Instrumental/Chorus]
 
B* B*  A*  D*  E E       x2
 
 
[Bridge]
 
  E       F#* B*
I thought I was
    E     F#*   B*
The Bally table king
    E F#*  B*
But I just handed
   G*               D* Dsus4* D*
My pinball crown to him
 
 
[Interlude]
 
Dsus4   D   x4
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
     Dsus4                  D
Even on my favourite table, he can beat my best
      Csus4                    C
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest
         Bbsus4                 Bb
He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall
     Asus4                     A N.C.
That deaf, dumb and blind kid, sure plays a mean pinball
