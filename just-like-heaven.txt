Verse 3:
[A]Daylight licked me [E]into shape
I [Bm]must have been a[D]sleep for days
And [A]moving lips to [E]breathe her name
I [Bm]opened up my [E]eyes
And [A]found myself a[E]lone, alone
A[Bm]lone above a [D]raging sea
That [A]stole the only [E]girl I loved
And [Bm]drowned her deep in[D]side of me
