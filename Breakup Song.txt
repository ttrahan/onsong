Greg Kihn Band
Key: A
Tempo: 142

Intro:
AmF G Am
      
AmF G Am
      


Verse 1:
       Am                         F          
We had broken up for good just an hour before
      G              Am
Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh

        Am                               F                      
Now I'm staring at the bodies as they're dancin' cross the floor
      G              Am
Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh

             Am                            F                 
And then the band slowed the tempo and the music took me down
      G              Am
Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh

(Play intro again)

           Am                     F               
It was the same old song with the melancholy sound
      G              Am
Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh


Chorus 1:
F          C                      G    D
They don't write 'em like that anymore 
F               C                      G   
They just don't write 'em like that anymore


Verse 2:
          Am                    F            
We'd been living together for a million years
      G              Am
Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh

           Am                          F          
But now it feels so strange out in the atmospheres
      G              Am
Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh

             Am                     F           
And then the jukebox plays a song I used to know
      G              Am
Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh

            Am                               F              
And now I'm staring at the bodies as they're dancin' so slow
      G              Am
Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh


Chorus 2:
F          C                      G    D
They don't write 'em like that anymore 
F               C                      G   
They just don't write 'em like that anymore

Verse 3:
            Am                    F          
Mmmm, now I wind up staring at an empty glass
      G              Am
Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh

            Am                      F               
Cuz it's so easy to say that she'll forget your past
      G              Am
Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh


Chorus 3:
F          C                      G    D   
They don't write 'em like that anymore   no
F               C                      G   
They just don't write 'em like that anymore

F          C                      G    D
They don't write 'em like that anymore 
F               C                      G   
They just don't write 'em like that anymore

F               C             G      D     
They just don't no they don't  no no  uh uh
