Verse 1:
I [E]live in an a[A]partment on the 
[B]ninety-ninth [A]floor of my [E]block  [A][B][A]

And I sit at home looking out the window
Imaginin' the world has stopped

Then in flies a guy 
Who's all dressed up just like a union jack

And says, I've won five pounds 
If I have his kind of detergent pack


Chorus 1:
I said, [E]hey! you! get [A]off of my [B]cloud
[E]Hey! you! get [A]off of my [B]cloud
[E]Hey! you! get [A]off of my [B]cloud
[D]Don t hang around 'cause [B]twos a crowd, [E]baby [A][B][A]


Verse 2:
[E]The telephone is [A]ringing
I say, [B]hi, its me [A]who is it there on the [E]line?  [A][B][A]

A voice says, hi, hello, how are you
Well, I guess I m doing fine

He says, its three a.m., 
There's too much noise, don't you people ever wanna go to bed? 

Just cause you feel so good
Do you have to drive me out of my head? 


Chorus 2:
I said, [E]hey! you! get [A]off of my [B]cloud
[E]Hey! you! get [A]off of my [B]cloud
[E]Hey! you! get [A]off of my [B]cloud
[D]Don t hang around cause [B]twos a crowd, [E]baby [A][B][A]
 

Verse 3:
[E]I was sick and [A]tired, fed up with [B]this
And decided to [A]take a drive down[E]town  [A][B][A]

It was so very quiet and peaceful
There was nobody, not a soul around

I laid myself out
I was so tired and I started to dream

In the morning the parking tickets
Were just like a flag stuck on my window screen


Chorus 3
I said, [E]hey! you! get [A]off of my [B]cloud
[E]Hey! you! get [A]off of my [B]cloud
[E]Hey! you! get [A]off of my [B]cloud
[D]Don t hang around cause [B]twos a crowd, [E]baby [A][B][A]

I said, [E]hey! you! get [A]off of my [B]cloud
[E]Hey! you! get [A]off of my [B]cloud
[E]Hey! you! get [A]off of my [B]cloud
[D]Don t hang around cause [B]twos a crowd, [E]baby [A][B][A]
