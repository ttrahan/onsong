Verse 1:
[E]Please allow me to intro[D]duce myself
I'm a [A]man of wealth and [E]taste
I've been around for a [D]long, long year
[A]Stole many a man's soul and [E]faith
 
[E]And I was 'round when [D]Jesus Christ
Had his [A]moment of doubt and [E]pain
Made damn sure that [D]Pilate
Washed his [A]hands and sealed his [E]fate

 
Chorus 1:
[B]Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my [E]name
But what's [B]puzzling you
Is the nature of my [E]game


Verse 2:
[E]I stuck around St. [D]Petersburg
When I [A]saw it was a time for a [E]change
Killed the Czar and his [D]ministers
Anas[A]tasia screamed in [E]vain
 
I [E]rode a tank
Held a [D]general's rank
When the [A]Blitzkrieg raged
And the [E]bodies stank


Chorus 2:
[B]Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my [E]name
But what's [B]puzzling you
Is the nature of my [E]game


Verse 3:
I [E]watched with glee
While your [D]kings and queens
Fought for [A]ten decades
For the [E]Gods they made
 
I [E]shouted out
"Who killed the [D]Kennedys?"
When [A]after all
It was [E]you and me
 
[E]Let me please intro[D]duce myself
I'm a [A]man of wealth and [E]taste
And I laid traps for [D]troubadours
Who get [A]killed before they reached Bom[E]bay


Chorus 3:
[B]Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my [E]name
But what's [B]puzzling you
Is the nature of my [E]game
oh yeah, get down, baby

Chorus 4:
[B]Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my [E]name
But what's [B]puzzling you
Is the nature of my [E]game

 
Verse4:
Just as [E]every cop is a [D]criminal
And [A]all the sinners [E]saints
As heads is tails just call me [D]Lucifer
'Cause I'm in [A]need of some re[E]straint
 
[E]So if you meet me
Have some [D]courtesy
Have some [A]sympathy, and some [E]taste
Use all your well-learned pol[D]itesse
Or I'll [A]lay your soul to [E]waste, um yeah


Chorus 5:
 [B]Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my [E]name
But what's [B]puzzling you
Is the nature of my [E]game
um baby, get down
