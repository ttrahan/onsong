Verse 1:
 
[F]              [G]
  Every time I think of you
       [Em]                        [Am]
I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue
        [F]                          [G]
It's no problem of mine but it's a problem I find
[Em]                       [Am]
Living a life that I can't leave behind


[F]                   [G]
There's no sense in telling me
    [Em]                     [Am]
The wisdom of a fool won't set you free
              [F]
But that's the way that it goes
              [G]
And it's what nobody knows
      [Em]           [Am]
And every day my confusion grows
 
 
Chorus 1:
 
[F]             [G]
Every time I see you falling
  [Em]               [Am]
I get down on my knees and pray
  [F]                  [G]
I'm waiting for that final moment
      [Em]                   [Am]
You'll  say the words that I can't say
 
 
Verse 2:
 
[F]                 [G]
  I feel fine and I feel good
[Em]               [Am]
I'm feeling like I never should
         [F]                            [G]
Whenever I get this way, I just don't know what to say
    [Em]                                 [Am]
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday


[F]                 [G]
I'm not sure what this could mean
[Em]                   [Am]
I don't think you're what you seem
     [F]
I do admit to myself
          [G]
That if I hurt someone else
          [Em]                        [Am]
Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be
 
 
Chorus 2:
 
[F]             [G]
Every time I see you falling
  [Em]               [Am]
I get down on my knees and pray
  [F]                  [G]
I'm waiting for that final moment
      [Em]                   [Am]
You'll  say the words that I can't say
