New York, New York
Frank Sinatra
key: D



[D]  [Em]  [D]  [Em]
[D]  [Em]  [D]  [Em]  [A7] 

Start spreading the [D] news
I’m leaving to[Em]day
I want to [D] be a part of it
New York, New [Em] York [A]

These vagabond [D] shoes
Are longing to [Em] stray
Right through the [D] very heart of it
New York, New [Am7] York [D7]

I want to [G] wake up
In a [Gm] city that doesn’t [D] sleep
And find I’m [F#m] king of the hill
[B7] Top of the [Em] heap [A]

These little town [D] blues
Are melting a[Em]way
I’ll make a [D] brand new start of it
In old New [Am7] York [D7]

If I can [G]  make it [Gm] there
I’ll make it [D] … any[B7]where
It’s up to [Em] you
[F#m] New [G] York [A] New [D] York

[D]  [Em]  [A7]

I want to [G] wake up
In a [Gm] city that never [D] sleeps
And find I’m [F#m] A-number [B7] one
[F#m] Top of the list
[Bb] King of the hill
[A]  A-number one

(slowly - big finish Tom!)
These little town [D] blues
Are melting a[Em]way
I’ll make a [D] brand new start of it
In old New [Em] York

If I can [G] make it [Gm] there
I’ll make it [F#m]  any[B7]where
Come on [Em] through
[A] New [Em] York [A] New [D] Yooooooooork

(pause, then a quick strum for the next two chords)
[A] New [D] York
