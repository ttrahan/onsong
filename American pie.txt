American pie
Don McLean
Key: A
Capo: 2

Intro (slow):
  A     E    F#m7    
A long, long time ago
Bm            D               F#m                   E    
I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
      A         E    F#m7         
And I knew that if I had my chance
Bm                 D                F#m             D           E    
I could make those people dance and maybe they'd be happy for a while
    F#m      Bm                   F#m         Bm         
But February made me shiver, with every paper I'd deliver
D        D/C#   Bm          D                 E        
Bad news on the doorstep, I couldn't take one more step
  A       E      F#m               Bm7            E            
I can't remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride
    A         E          F#m         (speed up)D       E7    A    D - G
But something touched me deep inside the day the music died 

Chorus:
   A    D        A        E  
So bye, bye Miss American Pie
         A            D            A        E  
Drove my chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
     A        D                  A           E  
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
        F#m                       B7 
Singing this'll be the day that I die
F#m                       E7  full speed from here
This'll be the day that I die 

Verse 1:
A                 Bm          
Did you write the book of love
       D                 Bm       
And do you have faith in God above
F#m          E            
If the Bible tells you so?
   A     E        F#m           
Do you believe in rock and roll?
    Bm7             D           
Can music save your mortal soul?
    F#m              B7                E    
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Pre-chorus:
       F#m                 E            
Well I know that you're in love with him
      F#m             E         
Cos I saw you dancing in the gym
    D           D/C#     B7   
You both kicked off your shoes
      D                    E7   
Man I dig those rythmn and blues
        A      E       F#m          
I was a lonely teenage broncing buck
       Bm                   D            
With a pink carnation and a pick-up truck
      A    E     F#m        
But I knew I was out of luck
    D       E7    A    D - G
The day the music died 
          E7     
I started singing

Chorus:
A    D        A        E  
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
         A            D            A        E  
Drove my chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
     A        D                  A           E  
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
        F#m                       B7 
Singing this'll be the day that I die
F#m                       E7 
This'll be the day that I die

Verse 2:
        A                    Bm        
Now for ten years we've been on our own
    D                   Bm           
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
    F#m               E         
But that's not how it used to be
         A      E            F#m           
When the jester sang for the King and Queen
     Bm7              D              
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
      F#m           B7                E 
And a voice that... came from you and me

Pre-chorus:
       F#m                E           
Oh and while the King was looking down
    F#m              E           
The jester stole his thorny crown
    D         D/C#  B7     
The courtroom was adjourned
   D             E7    
No verdict was returned
          A      E      F#m         
And while Lennon read a book on Marx
    Bm                  D          
The court kept practice in the park
    A       E      F#m        
And we sang dirges in the dark
    D       E7    A    D-G
The day the music died 
        E7     
We were singing

Chorus:
A    D        A        E  
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
         A            D            A        E  
Drove my chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
     A        D                  A           E  
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
        F#m                       B7 
Singing this'll be the day that I die
F#m                       E7 
This'll be the day that I die

Verse 3:
A                   Bm            
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
    D                     Bm             
The Byrds flew off with a fallout shelter
F#m                  E              
Eight Miles High and falling fast...
   A      E        F#m         
It landed foul out on the grass
    Bm7                 D           
The players tried for a forward pass
         F#m           B7             E   
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Pre-chorus:
        F#m               E            
Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
      F#m                E            
While sargeants played a marching tune
   D       D/C#  B7   
We all got up to dance
       D             E7    
But we never got the chance
        A       E        F#m           
Cos the players tried to take the field
    Bm              D             
The marching band refused to yield
A        E         F#m         
Do you recall what was revealed
    D       E7    A     D-G
The day the music died?  
           E7     
We started singing

Chorus:
A    D        A        E  
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
         A            D            A        E  
Drove my chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
     A        D                  A           E  
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
        F#m                       B7 
Singing this'll be the day that I die
F#m                       E7 
This'll be the day that I die

Verse 4:
    A                 Bm          
And there we were all in one place
  D          Bm           
A generation lost in space
     F#m             E          
With no time left to start again
           A               F#m           
So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick 
     Bm7            D          
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
    F#m         B7           E     
Cos fire is the Devil's only friend

Pre-chorus:
    F#m              E           
And as I watched him on the stage
   F#m                    E            
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
   D     D/C#    B7  
No angel born in hell
      D                  E7   
Could break that Satan's spell
           A              E      F#m         
And as the flames climbed high into the night
   Bm             D         
To light the sacrifical rite
      A     E        F#m         
I saw Satan laughing with delight
    D       E7    A    D - G
The day the music died 
       E7     
He was singing

Chorus:
A    D        A        E  
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
         A            D             A        E  
Drove my chevy to the levy, but the levy was dry
     A        D                  A           E  
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
        F#m                       B7 
Singing this'll be the day that I die
F#m                       E7 
This'll be the day that I die

Verse 5 (softly and slowly):
  A     A/G#     F#m           
I met a girl who sang the blues
      D                  Bm        
And I asked her for some happy news
    F#m                 E          
But she just smiled and turned away
  A    A/G#        F#m         
I went down to the sacred store
          D               Bm          
Where I'd heard the music years before
        F#m                B7             E   
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

Pre-chorus:
    F#m                E                
And in the streets the children screamed
    F#m                  E            
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
D         D/C#     B7    
But not a word was spoken
    D                     E7    
The Church bells all were broken
    A         A/G#F#m      
And three men I admire most
    D       D/C#        Bm        
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
     A          E          F#m          
They caught the last train for the coast
    D       E7    A    D - Gpick up speed
The Day the music died  
              E7     
And they were singing

Chorus:
   A    D        A        E  
So bye, bye Miss American Pie
         A            D             A        E  
Drove my chevy to the levy, but the levy was dry
     A        D                  A           E  
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
        F#m                       B7 
Singing this'll be the day that I die
F#m                       E7    
This'll be the day that I die...
They were singing

End:
   A    D        A        E  
So bye, bye Miss American Pie
         A            D             A        E  
Drove my chevy to the levy, but the levy was dry
     A        D                  A           E  
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
        D              E          A  
Singing this'll be the day that I die
