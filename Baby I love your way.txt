Baby I love your way
Peter Frampton
Key: G

Verse 1:
G               Bm             Em  
Shadows grow so long before my eyes
            C          F7            
And they're moving... across the page
G            Bm             Em   
Suddenly the day turns into night
     C      F7           
Far away... from the city
    Bm        E7  
But don't hesitate
         Am            D7  
Cos your love... won't wait

Chorus:
G   D                Am         C  
Ooh baby I love your way, every day
G     D                    Am        C  
Wanna tell you I love your way, ever day

Wanna be with you night and day, hey yey

Verse 2:
G               Bm                  Em 
Moon appears to shine and light the sky
         C            F7     
with the help of some firefly
G               Bm                Em   
Wonder how they have the power to shine
      C                  F7  
I can see them under the pine
    Bm        E7            Am         D7  
But don't hesitate cos your love won't wait

G   D                Am         C  
Ooh baby I love your way, every day
G     D                    Am        C  
Wanna tell you I love your way, ever day
G     D                     Am   C   G  
Wanna be with you night and day, hey yey

Verse 3:
G             Bm             Em  
I can see the sunset in your eyes
          C               F7   
Brown and grey and blue besides
G                   Bm             Em 
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
               C              F7    
I wish I could buy one out of season
    Bm        E7            Am         D7  
But don't hesitate cos your love won't wait

Chorus:
G   D                Am         C  
Ooh baby I love your way, every day
G     D                    Am        C  
Wanna tell you I love your way, ever day
G     D                     Am   C   G  
Wanna be with you night and day, hey yey

G               
One more time...
