Verse 1:
Ok, what is it tonight?
At least just tell me what the hell is wrong
Do you want to eat, do you want to sleep, do you want to drown?
Just settle down, settle down, settle down


Chorus 1:
***
I'll give you give candy, give you diamonds, give you pills,
Give you anything you want, hundred dollar bills,
I'll even let you watch the shows you want to see,
Just marry me, marry me, marry me

Verse 2:
I'm so sick of you tonight,
You never stay awake when I get home,
Is something wrong with me, something wrong with you?
I really wish I knew, wish I knew, wish I knew


Chorus 2:
***
I'll give you candy, give you diamonds, give you pills,
I'll give you anything you want, hundred dollar bills,
I even let you watch the shows you want to see,
Because you married me, married me, married me
Married me, married me, married me

Breakdown:
(drums and bass only)
When I was young, I learned a game
Where love and happiness were the same

(guitar starts to come in)
And now I'm older and I don't play
I found out the hardest way

(everyone back in)
***
I got wasted, she got mad
Called me names and she called her dad
He got crazy and I did too
Wonder what I did to you?


Chorus 3:
I'll give you candy, give you diamonds, give you pills,
I'll give you anything you want, hundred dollar bills,
I even let you hear the songs I want to sing,
I'll give you anything, anything, anything
I'll give you anything, anything, anything
I'll give you anything, anything, anything
Anything
Anything
