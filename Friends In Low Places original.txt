Friends in Low Places (2 verse)
Garth Brooks
key: A

Intro:
[A]   [Bbdim7]   [Bm7] 


Verse 1:
Blame it [A]all on my roots
I [Bbdim7]showed up in boots
And [Bm7]ruined your black tie affair   [E]

The [E]last one to know
The [E7]last one to show
I was the [A]last one you thought you'd see there

And I [A]saw the surprise
And the [Bbdim7]fear in his eyes
When [Bm7]I took his glass of cham[Dm7]pagne

[E]I toasted you
Said honey [E7]we may be through
But [E]you'll never hear me comp[E7]lain
 

Chorus 1:
'Cause [A]I got friends in low places
Where the [A]whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My b[Bm7]lues away
And I'll [E]be okay

Well [A]I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll [A]slip on down to the o[A7]asis
So [Bm7]I've got friends[E] 
In low p[A]laces


Solo 1:
[A]  [A]  [A]  [A]  [Bm7]  [E]  [A]  [A]
 

Verse 2:
Well, I [A]guess I was wrong
I [Bbdim7]just don't belong
But [Bm7]then, I've been there before

Every[E]thing's alright
I'll [E7]just say goodnight
And I'll [A]show myself to the door

Hey, [A]I didn't mean
To [Bbdim7]cause a big scene
Just [Bm7]give me an hour and [Dm7]then

Till [E]I'll be as high as that [E7]Ivory tower
[E] That you're livin' [E7]in
 

Chorus 2:
(Repeat as wanted)

'Cause [A]I got friends in low places
Where the [A]whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My b[Bm7]lues away
And I'll [E]be okay

Well [A]I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll [A]slip on down to the o[A7]asis
So [Bm7]I've got friends[E] 
In low p[A]laces
