Gin Blossoms

Intro:
[D]   [E]   [F#m]   [E]
[D]   [E]   [F#m]   [E]


Verse 1:
Tell me, do you [D]think it'd be al[E]right
If I could [F#m]just crash here to[E]night
You could see, I'm [D]in no shape for [E]driving
And anyway, I've [F#m]got no place to [E]go

And you know it might not be that bad
You were the best I'd ever had
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago
I might not be alone


Pre-Chorus:
Tomorrow we can [A]drive around this [D]town
And let the [A]cops chase us a[D]round
The past is gone but [F#m]something might be [E]found
To take its [D]place


Chorus:
Hey jealousy    [D]    [E]
Hey jealousy    [F#m]    [E]
Hey jealousy    [D]    [E]
Hey jealousy    [F#m]    [E]


Verse 2:
And you can [D]trust me not to [E]think
And [F#m]not to sleep a[E]round
If you don't expect too much from me
You might not be let down

Cause all I really want is to be with you
Feeling like I matter too
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago
I might be here with you


Pre-Chorus:
Tomorrow we can [A]drive around this [D]town
And let the [A]cops chase us a[D]round
The past is gone but [F#m]something might be [E]found
To take its [D]place

Hey jealousy...

Pre-Chorus:

Verse 3:
Well tell me, do you [D]think it'd be al[E]right
If I could [F#m]just crash here to[E]night
You could see, I'm [D]in no shape for [E]driving
And anyway, I've [F#m]got no place to [E]go

And you know it might not be that bad
You were the best I'd ever had
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago
I might not be alone

Hey jealousy  [D]    [E]
Listen to my heart  [F#m]    [E]
Well there's only [D]one thing I can [E]start
[F#]   [E]
