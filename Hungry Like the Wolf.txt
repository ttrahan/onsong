Verse 1:
E
Dark in the city, night is a wire

Steam in the subway, the earth is afire
      D                                               E   
Do do doo do - do doo do - do doo do - do doo do - do do
E
Woman you want me, give me a sign

And catch my breathing even closer behind
      D                                               E
Do do doo do - do doo do - do doo do - do doo do - do do


Chorus 1:
C                 G                  F
In touch with the ground, I'm on the hunt I'm after you
               C                       G
Smell like I sound, I'm lost in a crowd
        F               D
And I'm hungry like the wolf
             C                      G                 F
Straddle the line, in discord and rhyme, I'm on the hunt I'm after you
          C                   G             F               D        
Mouth is alive, with juices like wine, and I'm hungry like the wolf


Verse 2:
E
Stalked in the forest, too close to hide

I'll be upon you by the moonlight side
      D                                               E   
Do do doo do - do doo do - do doo do - do doo do - do do
E
High blood drumming on your skin, it's so tight

You feel my heat, I'm just a moment behind
      D                                               E   
Do do doo do - do doo do - do doo do - do doo do - do do


Chorus 2:
C                 G                  F
In touch with the ground, I'm on the hunt I'm after you
               C                       G
Scent and a sound, I'm lost and I'm found
        F               D
And I'm hungry like the wolf
             C                      G                 F
Strut on the line, it's discord and rhyme, I howl and I whine I'm after you
          C                      G             F               D        
Mouth is alive, all running inside, and I'm hungry like the wolf

Hungry like the wolf, 
Hungry like the wolf, 
Hungry like the wolf…

        F               D
And I'm hungry like the wolf
             C                      G                 F
Strut on a line, it's discord and rhyme, I'm on the hunt I'm after you
          C                      G             F               D
