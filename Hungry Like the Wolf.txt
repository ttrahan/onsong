(riff x4)
[E] 


Verse 1:
[E]Dark in the city, night is a wire
Steam in the subway, the earth is afire
Do do [D]doo do - do doo do - do doo do - do doo do - do [E]do  
[E]Woman you want me, give me a sign
And catch my breathing even closer behind
Do do [D]doo do - do doo do - do doo do - do doo do - do [E]do

Chorus 1:
[C]In touch with the [G]ground, I'm on the [F]hunt I'm after you
Smell like I so[C]und, I'm lost in a crowd[G] 
And I'm [F]hungry like the [D]wolf
Straddle the [C]line, in discord and rh[G]yme, I'm on the hu[F]nt I'm after you
Mouth is a[C]live, with juices li[G]ke wine, and I[F]'m hungry like t[D]he wolf  

Verse 2:
[E]Stalked in the forest, too close to hide
I'll be upon you by the moonlight side
Do do [D]doo do - do doo do - do doo do - do doo do - do [E]do  
[E]High blood drumming on your skin, it's so tight
You feel my heat, I'm just a moment behind
Do do [D]doo do - do doo do - do doo do - do doo do - do [E]do  

Chorus 2:
[C]In touch with the [G]ground, I'm on the [F]hunt I'm after you
Scent and a sou[C]nd, I'm lost and I'm fou[G]nd
And I'm [F]hungry like the [D]wolf
Strut on the [C]line, it's discord and [G]rhyme, I howl and [F]I whine I'm after you
Mouth is a[C]live, all running insid[G]e, and I'm hun[F]gry like the wol[D]f        

Bridge: (8 bars)
[E]Hungry like the wolf, 
Hungry like the wolf, 
Hungry like the wolf…

Chorus 3:
[C]Burning the ground[G], I’ll break from the crowd
[F]I'm on the hunt I'm after you
I smell like I [C]sound, I'm lost and I'm [G]found
And I'm [F]hungry like the [D]wolf
Strut on a li[C]ne, it's discord and rh[G]yme, I'm on the hu[F]nt I'm after you
Mouth is a[C]live, with juices like [G]wine, and I'm [F]hungry like the [D]wolf     

Chorus 4:
[C]Burning the ground[G], I break from the crowd
[F]I'm on the hunt I'm after you
A scent and the[C] sound, I'm lost and I'm[G] found
And I'm [F]hungry like the [D]wolf
Strut on a li[C]ne, it's discord and rh[G]yme, I howl and I [F]whine I'm after you
Mouth is a[C]live, I'm running insid[G]e, and I'm hun[F]gry like the wol[D]f
