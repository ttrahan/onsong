[Verse 1]
 
    D           Dsus4 D Dsus2  D
It's all the same
Cadd9               G
Only the names will change
Cadd9     G        C/G  F        D
Every day   it seems we're wasting away
 D           Dsus4 D  Dsus2 D
Another place
          Cadd9      G
Where the faces are so cold
    Cadd9     G
I'd drive all night
        C/G F    D
Just to get back home
 
 
[Chorus]
 
        Cadd9  G       F     D  Dsus2  D
I'm a cowboy,   on a steel horse   I  ride
     Cadd9  G   C      F   D
I'm wanted     dead or alive
Cadd9   G    C      F   D
Wanted     dead or alive
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
    D            Dsus4 D Dsus2  D
Sometimes I sleep,
    Cadd9              G
Sometimes it's not for days
	Cadd9     G        C/G  F        D
The people I meet always go their separate ways
    D                     Dsus4 D Dsus2 D
Sometimes you tell the day
       Cadd9        G
By the bottle that you drink
    Cadd9     G        C/G  F        D
And times when you're alone, well, all you do is think
 
 
[Chorus]
 
    Cadd9  G       F     D  Dsus2  D
I'm a cowboy,   on a steel horse   I  ride
     Cadd9  G   C      F   D
I'm wanted     dead or alive
Cadd9   G    C      F   D
Wanted     dead or alive
 
 
[Solo]
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
  D                  Dsus4 D Dsus2  D
I walk these streets,
         Cadd9          G
A loaded six string on my back
  Cadd9     G        C/G  F        D
I play for keeps, 'cause I might not make it back
     D               Dsus4 D Dsus2  D
I've been everywhere,
          Cadd9    G
Still I'm standing tall
     Cadd9          G
I've seen a million faces
         C/G      F       D
And I've rocked them all
 
 
[Chorus]
 
      Cadd9   G          F           D  Dsus2 D
I'm a cowboy, I got the night on my side
      Cadd9   G  C   F    D
I'm   wanted    dead or alive
      C       F       G
      dead or         alive
      C       F       D
      dead or         alive
