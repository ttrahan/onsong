Verse 1:
G             C      G             D        
Hey where did we go, days when the rain came
G           C       G         D       
Down in the hollow, playing a new game
G              C        G              D      
Laughing and a running, skipping and a jumping
G            C            G                 D            C  
In the misty morning fog, with our hearts a thumping and you

Whatever happened, to Tuesday and so slow
G                 C         G                 D    
Going down to the old mine, with a transistor radio
G               C                  G               D             
Standing in the sunlight laughing, hiding behind a rainbow's wall
G              C        G                       D    C  
Slipping and a sliding, all along the waterfall with you

          C          
Sha la la la la la la

La te da, just like that

Sha la la la la la la

La te da, la ti da

So hard to find my way, now that I'm all on my own
G                  C          G       D             
I saw you just the other day- my, how you have grown
G              C                G             D                         
Cast my memory back there Lord, sometimes I'm overcome thinking 'bout it
G                  C            G          D            C  
Making love in the green grass, behind the stadium with you
