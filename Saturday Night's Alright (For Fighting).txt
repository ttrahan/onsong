Verse 1:
[G]
It's getting late have you seen my mates
   [F]
Ma tell me when the boys get here
     [C]
It's seven o'clock and I want to rock
        [G]
Want to get a belly full of beer
   [G]
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
       [F]
And my old lady she don't care
   [C]
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
  [G]
A handful of grease in her hair
[Dm7/G#]
Ohhhhhhh
 
 
Chorus 1:
[C]
 Don't give us none of your aggravation
   [A#]
We had it with your discipline
[F]
Saturday night's alright for fighting
[C]
Get a little action in
[C]
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
[A#]
Gonna set this dance alight
       [F]
`Cause Saturday night's the night I like
[C]                                     [G]

Verse 2:
             [G]
Well they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
    [F]
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
      [C]
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
      [G]
I may sink a little drink and shout out "She's with me!"
  [G]
A couple of the sounds that I really like
        [F]
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
      [C]
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
      [G]
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass
[Dm7]         ↓Gliss…
Ohhhhhhh
