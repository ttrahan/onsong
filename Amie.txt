[Intro]

A
 
 
[Verse 1]
G D A            G         D         A
   I can see why you think you belong to me
G D  A                  G          D      A                              D
   I never tried to make you think, or let you see one thing for yourself
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                C                               D
But now your off with someone else and I'm alone
          C                                    E6
You see I thought that I might keep you for my own
 
 
[Chorus]
A         G               D
 Amie what you want to do?

A         G                   D
 I think I could stay with you
            Bm                    E
For a while,  maybe longer if I do
 
 
[Interlude]
A G D A G D
 
 
[Verse 2]
A                       G        D      A
Don't you think the time is right for us to find
G D A                        G        D           A
    All the things we thought weren't proper could be right in time
               D
And can you see
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
          C                               D
Which way we should turn together or alone
      C                                 E6
I can never see what's right or what is wrong
(will it take to long to see)
 
 
[Chorus]
A         G               D
 Amie what you want to do?
A         G                   D
 I think I could stay with you
            Bm                    E
For a while,  maybe longer if I do
 
 
[Interlude]
A G D A G D

C D C E6
Well now
 
 
[Chorus]
A         G               D
 Amie what you want to do?
A         G                   D
 I think I could stay with you
            Bm                    E
For a while,  maybe longer if I do

[Verse 3]
A                    G    D              A
Now it's come to what you want you've had your way
G D    A                         G      D        A
   And all the things you thought before just faded into gray
               D
And can you see
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                 C                         D
That I don't know if it's you or if it's me
        C                                 E6
If it's one of us I'm sure we'll both will  see
Won't you look at me and tell me
 
 
[Chorus]
A         G               D
 Amie what you want to do?
A         G                   D
 I think I could stay with you
            Bm
For a while,  maybe longer if I
E
Longer if I do
Yeah now
A         G               D
 Amie what you want to do?
A         G                   D
 I think I could stay with you
            Bm                    E
For a while,  maybe longer if I do
 
 
[Outro]
A                          A7sus4        Dadd9/A
 Fallin' in and out of love      with you
A                          A7sus4        Dadd9/A
 Fallin' in and out of love      with you
A                             A7sus4 Dadd9/A
 Don't know what I'm gonna do,              I'd keep
A                          A7sus4 Dadd9/A
 Fallin' in and out of love
With you
Dmadd9/A Amaj7sus4 Aadd9
