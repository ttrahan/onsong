Key: E
 
 
VERSE 1:
[E]
Jump back, what's that sound?
Here she comes, full blast and top down
Hot shoe, burnin' down the avenue
Model citizen zero discipline
 
 
PRE-CHORUS:
[F#]
 Don't you know she's coming home with me ?
[C#m]
  You'l lose her in the turn
             [A5] [G5]
I'll get her!
[F#5] [B]     [E]
     Panama , Panama
 
 
CHORUS:
Panama , Panama
 
 
VERSE 2:
[E]
  Ain't nothin' like it, her shiny machine
Got the feel for the wheel, keep the
Moving parts clean
Hot shoe, burnin' down the avenue
Got an onramp
Comin' through my bedroom
 
 
PRE-CHORUS:
[F#]
 Don't you know she's coming home with me ?
[C#m]
  You'l lose her in the turn
             [A5] [G5]
I'll get her!
[F#5] [B]     [E]
     Panama , Panama
 
 
CHORUS:
          [C][A]
Panama , Panama

BREAK:
[Em] [C] [Em] [F]
[Em]
                                       [C]
Yeah, we're runnin' a little bit hot tonight
[Em]
   I can barely see the road from the heat comin' off of it
[C]                  [Em]                [C]
 Ah , you reach down, between my legs, ease the seat back
 
 
BRIDGE:
[Em]               [F]
   She's blinding, I'm flying
[D/F#]                    [G]
    Right behind the rearview mirror now
[G#5]               [A]
  Got the feeling,  power steering
[A#5]                  [B]
  Pistons popping, ain't no stopping now!
 
 
CHORUS:
       [E]
Panama , Panama
Panama , Panama 

       [E]
Panama , Panama
Panama!
