          A        D   A     
There she stood in the street
Dadd4            D           A    
Smiling from her head to her feet,
        A          D  A      
I said ''Hey, what is this?''
              Dadd4       D         A    
Now  baby, maybe she's in need of a kiss.

I said 'Hey, what's your name, baby,
maybe we can see things the same.
Now don't you wait or  hesitate,
Let's move before they raise the parking rate.''


A         G              D         A  
All right now Baby, it's all right now
A         G              D         A  
All right now Baby, it's all right now

I took her home to my place
Watching ev'ry move on her face,
She said ''Look, what's your game baby
are you tryin' to put in shame?''

I said ''slow, don't go so fast,
don't you think that love can last?''
She said ''Love, Lord above,
now you're tryin' to trick me in love.''


All right now baby, it's all right now
All right now baby, it's all right now
