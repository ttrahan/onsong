[Verse 1] 
[E]Gassed up my ride
And hit the o[D]pen r[A]oad
[E]Didn't know where it would take me
Knew where I [D]was [A]goin'
[E]Breeze through the windows
My guitar in [D]the [A]back/seat
[E]Truth is I'm still standing
In the same [D]cul de [A]sac/old street

[Pre Chorus]
Where I went to [D]school
Maybe broke a few [A]rules
Acted so [D]tough
But it was [A]only a [B]bluuuuuuuff

On the [G]streeeeeeeeets [B]ooooooooof
 

[Verse 2]
[E]Crowd's goin' crazy
And they're [D]packed in [A]tight
[E]I'm in fine form
Up in [D]the [A]lights
[E]They all cheer out
For one more [D]song from the [A]stage
[E]Truth is I'm still trapped
In the [D]same [A]rusty cage

[Pre Chorus]
Where I went to [D]school
Maybe broke a few [A]rules
Acted so [D]tough
But it was [A]only a [B]bluuuuuuuff
