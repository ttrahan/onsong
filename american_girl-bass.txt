Verse 1:
Well, she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinkin' that there was a
Little more more to life somewhere else

Pre-Chorus:
After all it was a great big world
With lost of places to run to
And if she had to die tryin' she
Had one little promise she was gonna keep

Chorus:
Oh yeah, all right, 
Take it easy, baby 
Make it last (make it last all night)
She was an American girl

Verse 2:
Well, it was kinda cold that night
She stood alone over a balcony
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by
Out on 441, like waves crashin' on the beach

Pre-Chorus:
And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God it's so painful when something that's so close 
Is still so far out of reach

Chorus:
Oh yeah, all right, 
Take it easy, baby 
Make it last (make it last all night)
She was an American girl
