[Verse 1]
 
A [G]long, [D/F#]long [Em7]time ago,
[Am]I can still re[C]member how that 
[Em]music used to make me [D]smile

And [G]I knew [D/F#]if I [Em7]had my chance,
That [Am]I could make those [C]people dance and 
[Em]maybe they'd be [C]happy for a [D]while

But [Em]February [Am]made me shiver
with [Em]every paper [Am]I'd deliver
[C]Bad news [G/B]on the [Am]doorstep, 
I [C]couldn't take one [D]more step

I [G]can't re[D/F#]member [Em]if I cried 
when I [Am7]read about his [D]widowed bride
[G]Something [D/F#]touched me [Em]deep inside
The [C]day the [D7]music [G]died
 
 
[Chorus]
 
So [G]bye, [C]bye Miss A[G]merican [D]Pie
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levy but the [G]levy was [D]dry
And them [G]good old [C]boys were drinkin' [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin' [Em]this will be the day that I [Am7]die
[Em]this will be the day that I [D7]die
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
[G]Did you write the [Am]book of love
And do [C]you have faith in [Am]god above
[Em]if the bible [D]tells you so?

Do [G]you be[D/F#]lieve in [Em]rock and roll
Can [Am7]music save your [C]mortal soul
and [Em]can you teach me [A7]how to dance [D]real slow?

Well I [Em]know that you're in [D]love with him
'cuz I [Em]saw you dancin' [D]in the gym

You [C]both kicked [G/B]off your [A7]shoes
man I [C]dig those rhythm and [D7]blues

I was a [G]lonely [D/F#]teenage bronckin' [Em]buck 
with a [Am]pink carnation and a [C]pickup truck

But I [G]knew [D/F#]I was [Em]out of luck 
the [C]day the [D7]music [G]died    
[C]  [G]     I started singin'
 
 
[Chorus]
 
[G]Bye, [C]bye Miss A[G]merican [D]Pie
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levy but the [G]levy was [D]dry
And them [G]good old [C]boys were drinkin' [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin' [Em]this will be the day that I [Am7]die
[Em]this will be the day that I [D7]die
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
Now for [G]ten years we've been [Am]on our own,
and [C]moss grows fat on a [Am]rolling stone 
[Em]but that's not how it [D]used to be

When the [G]jester [D/F#]sang for the [Em]king and queen 
in a [Am7]coat he [C]borrowed from James [Em]Dean
in a [A7]voice that came from you and [D]me

Oh, and [Em]while the king was [D]looking down
the [Em]jester stole his [D]thorny crown
The [C]courtroom [G/B]was ad[A7]journed
[C]no verdict was re[D7]turned

And while [G]Lennon [D/F#]read a [Em]book on Marx
the [Am]quartet practiced [C]in the park

And [G]we sang [D/F#]dirges [Em]in the dark 
the [C]day the [D7]music [G]died    
[C]    [G]   we were singin'
 
 
[Chorus]
 
[G]Bye, [C]bye Miss A[G]merican [D]Pie
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levy but the [G]levy was [D]dry
And them [G]good old [C]boys were drinkin' [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin' [Em]this will be the day that I [Am7]die
[Em]this will be the day that I [D7]die
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
[G]Helter skelter [Am]in a summer swelter
the [C]birds flew off with a [Am]fallout shelter
[Em]eight miles high and [D]fallin' fast

It [G]landed [D/F#]foul [Em]on the grass
the [Am7]players tried for a [C]forward pass
with the [Em]jester on the [A7]sidelines in a [D]cast

Now the [Em]half-time air was [D]sweet perfume
[Em]while sergeants played a [D]marching tune

We [C]all [G/B]got up to [A7]dance
but we [C]never got the [D7]chance

'Cuz the [G]players [D/F#]tried to [Em]take the field
the [Am]marching band re[Cm]fused to yield

[G]Do you re[D/F#]call what [Em]was revealed 
the [C]day the [D7]music [G]died    
[C]    [G]   we started singin'
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G    C        G        D
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
         G            C            G        D
Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
         G        C                  G           D
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
        Em*                         A7*   Em*                         D7
Singin' this will be the day that I die, this will be the day that I die
 
 
[Verse 5]
 
     G                Am
And there we were all in one place,
    C        Am            Em                   D
a generation lost in space, with no time left to start again
            G      D/F#   Em               Am7                 C
So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack Flash sat on a candle 
       Em                   A7             D
stick, 'cuz fire is the devil's only friend
     Em*              D*               Em*                    D*
And as I watched him on the stage, my hands were clenched in fists of rage
   C      G/B    A7         C                  D7
No angel born in Hell could break that Satan's spell
           G            D/F#      Em             Am              C
And as the flames climbed high into the night to light the sacrificial rite
       G   D/F#           Em           C      D7      G  C  G
I saw Satan laughing with delight the day the music died,     he was singin'
 
 
[Chorus]
 
[G]Bye, [C]bye Miss A[G]merican [D]Pie
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levy but the [G]levy was [D]dry
And them [G]good old [C]boys were drinkin' [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin' [Em]this will be the day that I [Am7]die
[Em]this will be the day that I [D7]die
 
 
[Verse 6]
 
[G]I met a [D/F#]girl who [Em]sang the blues
And I [Am]asked her for some [C]happy news
but [Em]she just smiled and [D]turned away

[G]I went [D/F#]down to the [Em]sacred store
Where I'd [Am]heard the [C]music years before
but the [Em]man there said the [C]music wouldn't [D]play

But [Em]in the streets the [Am]children screamed
the [Em]lovers cried and the [Am]poets dreamed
But [C]not a [G/B]word was [Am]spoken
the [C]church bells all were [D]broken

And the [G]three men {D/F#}I ad[Em]mire most
the [C]Father, Son, and the [D7]Holy Ghost
They [G]caught the [D/F#]last train [Em]for the coast 
the [C]day the [D7]music [G]died

And they were singin'
 
 
[Chorus]
 
[G]Bye, [C]bye Miss A[G]merican [D]Pie
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levy but the [G]levy was [D]dry
And them [G]good old [C]boys were drinkin' [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin' [Em]this will be the day that I [Am7]die
[Em]this will be the day that I [D7]die
 
They were singin' 
[G]Bye, [C]bye Miss A[G]merican [D]Pie
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levy but the [G]levy was [D]dry
And them [G]good old [C]boys were drinkin' [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin' [C]this will be the [D7]day that I [G]die [C]  [G]
