[Verse 1]
 
A                G                           D
Wake up Maggie I think I've got something to say to you
     A                    G                D
It's late September and I really should be back at school
  G                D           G              A
I know I keep you amused But I feel I'm being used
   Em                     F#m       Em     Dsus2/F#
Oh Maggie I couldn’t have tried any more
    Em               A            Em                   A
You led me away from home just to save you from being alone
    Em                  A                  D
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
    A                     G                   D
The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age
    A                   G                       D
But that don't worry me none, in my eyes you're everything
  G                   D         G                       A
I laughed at all your jokes, my love you didn't need to coax
   Em                     F#m       Em   Dsus2/F#  DM9/F#  A7sus2/E
Oh Maggie I couldn’t have tried any more
        Em           A            Em                  A
You led me away from home just to save you from being alone
    Em                     A          G      D
You stole my soul that's a pain I can do without
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
A                  G                D
All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
        A                       G                       D
But you turned into a lover and mother what a lover you wore me out
G                        D              G                      A
All you did was wreck my bed And in the morning kick me in the head
   Em                     F#m       Em   Dsus2/F#
Oh Maggie I couldn’t have tried any more
    Em               A               Em                 A
You led me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone
    Em                        A         G    D
You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried

[Verse 4]
 
A                 G                           D
I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
   A                G                            D
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing fool
   G                           D         G               A
Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helping hand
   Em                 F#m             Em   Dsus2/F#
Oh Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face
           Em                      A              Em                  A
You made a first class fool out of me, but I'm as blind as a fool can be
    Em                   A        G  D
You stole my heart but I love you anyway
