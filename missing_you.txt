Intro:
[E]    [Asus2]   [Bsus4]   x2
 
Verse 1:
[E]                            [Asus2]                    [Bsus4]
Every time I think of you, I always catch my breath
              [E]
And I'm still standing here, and you're miles away
        [Asus2]                 [Bsus4]
And I'm wonderin' why you left
              [C#m7]
And there's a storm that's raging 
           [Asus2]                [Bsus4]
through my frozen heart tonight
 
            [E]                               [Asus2]                [Bsus4]
I hear your name in certain circles, and it always makes me smile
           [E]                                 [Asus2]                 [Bsus4]
I spend my time thinkin' about you, and it's almost driving me wild
              [C#m7]                            [Asus2]                      [Bsus4]
And there's a heart that's breaking down this long distance line tonight
 
 
Chorus 1:
                        [E]                                   [Asus2]    [Bsus4]
I ain't missing you at all (missing you), since you've been gone away
                   [E]                          [Asus2]          [Bsus4]
I ain't missing you, (missing you)  no matter   what I might say
 
 
Verse 2:
          [E]                                [Asus2]                      [Bsus4]
There's a message in the wire, and I'm sending you this signal tonight
          [E]
You don't know how desperate I've become
       [Asus2]                           [Bsus4]
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
        [E]                                   [Asus2]                    [Bsus4]
In your world I have no meaning, though I'm trying hard to understand
[C#m7]                                [Asus2]                           [Bsus4]
  And it's my heart that's breaking down this long distance line tonight
 
 
Chorus 2:
                        [E]                                  [Asus2]    [Bsus4]
I ain't missing you at all (missing you) since you've been gone away
                    [E]                        [Asus2]              [Bsus4]
I ain't missing you, (missing you) no matter    what my friends say
 
 
Bridge:
[C#m7]
     And there's a message that I'm sending out,
     [Asus2]               [Bsus4]
Like a telegraph to your soul
[F#]
   And if I can't bridge this distance,
         [Asus2]               [Bsus4]
Stop this    heartbreak overload
 
 
Chorus 3:
                        [E]                                   [Asus2]    [Bsus4]
I ain't missing you at all, (missing you) since you've been gone away
                     [E]                         [Asus2]              [Bsus4]
I ain't missing you,   (missing you) no matter    what my friends say
        [E]                                 [Asus2]          [Bsus4]
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you...        I can lie to myself
 
[C#m7]                                            [Asus2]          [Bsus4]
  And there's a storm that's raging through my frozen heart tonight
                       [E]                                    [Asus2]    [Bsus4]
I ain't missing you at all, (missing you) since you've been gone away
                    [E]                       [Asus2]            [Bsus4]
I ain't missing you, (missing you) no matter what my friends say
 
 
Outro:
              [E]
Ain't missing you, (missing you) I ain't missing you
[Asus2]                  [Bsus4]
  I ain't missing you,  I can lie to myself
[E]
  Ain't missing you, I ain't missing you
[Asus2]                [Bsus4]
I ain't missing you,   I ain't missing you
[E]
I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you
[Asus2]                [Bsus4]
  ain't missing you,    oh no
[E]
   (missing you, missing you)
   [Asus2]                             [Bsus4]                   [E]
No matter what my friends might say, I ain't missing you...
