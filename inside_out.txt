(starts with no intro)

CHORUS:
[A]I would swallow my [E]pride, I would choke on the [B]rinds
But the lack thereof would leave me empty in[A/E]side
I would swallow my [E/B]doubt, turn it inside [F#]out
Find nothing but [F#m]faith in nothing

[A/E]I want to put my tender [E/B]heart in a blender
[B/F#]Watch it spin around to a [B/F#]beautiful oblivion
[A/E]  Rende[E/B]vous then I'm [F#]through now I'm [F#m]through with


VERSE 1:
[B]I burn burn like a [F#]wicker cabinet
[A]Chalk white and [G]oh so frail
[B]  I see our [F#]time here's gotten [E]stale

[B]The tick tock of the [F#]clock is painful
[A]All sane and [G]logical
[B]I want to [F#]tear it off the [E]wall

[B]I hear words in [F#]clips and phrases
[A]I think sick like [G]ginger ale
[B]My stomach [F#]turns and I [G]exhale


CHORUS:
[A]I would swallow my [E]pride, I would choke on the [B]rinds
But the lack thereof would leave me empty in[A/E]side
I would swallow my [E/B]doubt, turn it inside [F#]out
Find nothing but [F#m]faith in nothing

[A/E]I want to put my tender [E/B]heart in a blender
[B/F#]Watch it spin around to a [B/F#]beautiful oblivion
[A/E]  Rende[E/B]vous then I'm [F#]through now I'm [F#m]through with


VERSE 2:
[B]Socal is [F#]where my stays
[A]But it's not my [G]state of mind
[B]I'm not as [F#]ugly, sad as [E]you

[B]Or am I [F#]origami
[A]Folded up and [G]just pretend
[B]Demented as the [F#]motives in your [E]head


CHORUS:
[A]I would swallow my [E]pride, I would choke on the [B]rinds
But the lack thereof would leave me empty in[A/E]side

[B]ooooooh, [E]oooooh, [A]oooooh, [E]oooooh
[B]ooooooh, [E]oooooh, [A]oooooh, [E]oooooh

[B]I alone[E] am the one you [E]don't know
you need, take [A]heed, feed your ego
[B]Make me[E] blind when your eyes close, [E]sink
When you get close, [A]tie me to the bedpost

[B]I alone[E] am the one you [E]don't know
you need, you [A]don't know you need me
[B]Make me[E] blind when your eyes close, [E]
[A]tie me to the [E]bedpost
