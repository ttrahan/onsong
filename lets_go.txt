[Intro]
A (...) G-G A
(Let the A ring once, then palm mute a bit until the song kicks in. At the right time
G-G A)
 

[Verse 1]
A              D        A
She's driving away
A                   D   A
with the dim lights on
A                D      A
She's making her play
A                D      A
and she can't go wrong
          G         A
She never waits too long

A                  D           A
She's winding them down on her clock machine
A                  D               A
And she won't give up 'cause she's seventeen
        G      A
She's a frozen fire
         G     A
She's my one desire
 

[Pre-Chorus]
E                        E
I don't want to hold her down
                        D
Don't want to break her crown
         C
When she says,
         A  D     A
Let's go
 

[Chorus]
A          A         D     A
I like the nightlife baby
    C        A  D  A
She says,
A          A         D     A
I like the nightlife baby

    C
She says,
         A  D     A
Let's go!
 

[Verse 2]
(break - play like verse)
A                D    A    A           D       A
She's laughing inside      'cause they can't refuse
A                D    A    A           D       A
She's so beautiful now, she doesn't wear her shoes
          G        A
She never likes to choose
A         D         A    A     D      A
She's got wonderful eyes and a risqu√© mouth
A          D           A     A              D       A
And when I asked her before, she said she's holding out
        G      A
She's a frozen fire
        G      A
She's my one desire
 

[Pre-Chorus]
E                        E
I don't want to hold her down
                        D
Don't want to break her crown
         C
When she says,
         A  D     A
Let's go
 

[Chorus]
A          A         D     A
I like the nightlife baby
    C        A  D  A
She says,
A          A         D     A
I like the nightlife baby

    C
She says,
         A  D     A
Let's go!
