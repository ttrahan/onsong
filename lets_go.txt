Tempo: 131



[Intro]
A (...) G-G A
(Let the A ring once, then palm mute a bit until the song kicks in. At the right time
G-G A)
 

[Verse 1]
A              D        A
She's driving away
A                   D   A
with the dim lights on
A                D      A
She's making her play
A                D      A
and she can't go wrong
          G         A
She never waits too long
She's winding them down on her clock machine
And she won't give up 'cause she's seventeen
She's a frozen fire
She's my one desire
 

[Pre-Chorus]
E-E                      E-E
I don't want to hold her down
                        D-D
Don't want to break her crown
         C-C
When she says,
         A  D     A
Let's go
 

[Chorus]
A          A         D     A
I like the nightlife baby
She says,
I like the night life baby
She says,
Let's go!
 

[Verse 2]
(break - play like verse)
She's laughing inside 'cause they can't refuse
She's so beautiful now, she doesn't wear her shoes
She never likes to choose
She's got wonderful eyes and a risqu√© mouth
And when I asked her before, she said she's holding out
She's a frozen fire
She's my one desire
 

[Pre-Chorus]
E-E                      E-E
I don't want to hold her down
                        D-D
Don't want to break her crown
         C-C
When she says,
         A  D     A
Let's go
 

[Chorus]
A          A         D     A
I like the nightlife baby
She says,
I like the night life baby
She says,
Let's go!
