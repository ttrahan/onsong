   I was a little too tall
                                F
  Could've used a few pounds    
C                                       F
  Tight pants points hardly renown      
G                                                       F
  She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes      
C                                               F        
  And points all her own sitting way up high             
G       F
 /// ///
C                     F
  Way up firm and high
G                                                  F
  Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
C                                     F
  Out in the backseat of my '60 Chevy 
G                                       FC
  Workin on mysteries without any clues

Workin on our night moves    
D                       Em              D  C 
  Tryin to make some front page drive-in news

  In the summertime         
G                          F C F
  In the sweet summertime      
G                                          F
  We weren't in love, oh no, far from it   
C                                                             F
  We weren't searchin' for some pie in the sky summit         

G                                            F
  We were just young and restless and bored  
C                       F
  Livin' by the sword   
G                                            F
  And we'd steal away every chance we could  
C                                                    F
  To the backroom, to the alley or the trusty woods  
G                        
  I used her, she used me
                           F
  But neither one cared    
C                          
  We were getting our share

           D        Em                     D        C
Tryin to lose the awkward teenage blues             
              Em                   D     C
Workin on our night moves

C/B      G        
  Ohhh, the wonder
C/B                    
  We felt the lightning
F                             
  And we waited on the thunder
D                      
  Waited on the thunder

  I awoke last night to the sound of thunder 
                                  G
  How far off I sat and wondered  
                                  Cmaj7
  Started humming a song from 1962
                                Em        C
  Ain't it funny how the night moves      
                                Em                               C
  When you just don't seem to have as much to lose               
                      Em               C        Cmaj7
  Strange how the night moves                   
                                G
  With autumn closing in        


And another little fill before the last part.
