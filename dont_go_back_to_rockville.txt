Key: E


Intro:
(all in)
[E][  ][E]


[Verse 1] 
E
Looking at your watch a third time 
E                               A   Asus   A  Asus
waiting in the station for the bus 
E
Going to a place that's far, 
E                               A   Asus   A  Asus
so far away and if that's not enough 
B            A      G#m    C#m
Going where nobody says hello, 
C#m                   Bm          A
they don't talk to anybody they don't know 
E
You'll wind up in some factory 
E                               A   Asus   A  Asus
that's full time filth and nowhere left to go 
E
Walk home to an empty house, 
E                               A   Asus   A  Asus
sit around all by yourself 
B                     A           G#m  C#m
I know it might sound strange but I believe 
C#m                   Bm          A
You'll be coming back before too long 
 
[Chorus] 
E                F#m    B
Dont go back to Rockville, 
E                F#m  B
dont go back to Rockville, 
E                F#m   B
dont go back to Rockville 
A
And waste another year 
 
[Verse 2] 
E
At night I drink myself to sleep and pretend 
E                               A   Asus   A  Asus
I don't care that you're not here with me 
E
'Cause it's so much easier to handle 
E                               A   Asus   A  Asus
All my problems if I'm too far out to sea 
B            A      G#m    C#m
But something better happen soon 
C#m                          Bm          A
Or it's gonna be too late to bring me back 
 
[Chorus] 

E                F#m    B
Dont go back to Rockville, 
E                F#m  B
dont go back to Rockville, 
E                F#m   B
dont go back to Rockville 
A
And waste another year 
 
[Bridge] 
E                           A    B    A   B
It's not as though I really need you 
E                          A    B    A  B
If you were here I'd only bleed you 
F#m      C#m          F#m       C#m                A
But everybody else in town only wants to bring you down and 
           A               B
That's not how it ought to be [HARD BREAK]
            B              A            G#m    C#m
Well I know it might sound strange but I believe 
C#m                   Bm          A
You'll be coming back before too long 
 
[Chorus] 
E                F#m    B
Dont go back to Rockville 
E                F#m  B
dont go back to Rockville 
E                F#m   B
dont go back to Rockville 
A
And waste another year 
E                F#m    B
Dont go back to Rockville 
E                F#m  B
dont go back to Rockville 
E                F#m   B
dont go back to Rockville 
A
And waste another year
