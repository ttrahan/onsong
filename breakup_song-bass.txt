Verse 1:
We had broken up for good just an hour before, Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh Uh
Now I'm staring at the bodies as they're dancin' cross the floor, Uh Uh...
And then the band slowed the tempo and the music took me down, Uh Uh ...
It was the same old song with the melancholy sound, Uh Uh ...

Chorus 1:
They don't write 'em like that anymore 
They just don't write 'em like that anymore

Verse 2:
We'd been living together for a million years, Uh Uh ...
But now it feels so strange out in the atmospheres, Uh Uh...
And then the jukebox plays a song I used to know, Uh Uh ...
And now I'm staring at the bodies as they're dancin' so slow, Uh Uh ...

Chorus 2:
They don't write 'em like that anymore 
They just don't write 'em like that anymore

Verse 3:
---
---
Mmmm, now I wind up staring at an empty glass, Uh Uh ...
Cuz it's so easy to say that she'll forget your past, Uh Uh ...

Chorus 3:
They don't write 'em like that anymore   no
They just don't write 'em like that anymore
They don't write 'em like that anymore 
They just don't write 'em like that anymore
They just don't no they don't  no no  uh uh
