                            C   A#
                                   
When you gonna give me some time, Sharona?

Gun it coming off of the line, Sharona.
                               
 
Chorus 1:
 
G
     
Never gonna stop, give it       up. Such a dirty mind.

I always get it up, for the     touch of the younger kind.

                               C   A#
                                      
Close enough to look in my eyes, Sharona.                 Ooh,
G
                
Keeping it a mystery,          It gets to me.
                               C   A#
                                                                        
Running down the length of my thigh, Sharona.

                               C   A#
                                      
Is it just a matter of time, Sharona?
G
                
Is it D-D-destiny,         D-destiny,
                               C   A#
                                                                        
or is it just a game in my mind, Sharona?
