Verse 1:

      D                         D
I was cuttinâ€™ the rug down at a place called 'The Jug' 
       A                A
with a girl named Linda Lou 
     D                      D
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand 
       E                    A
he was looking for you know who. 


         D                         D
He said "Hey there fellow with the hair coloured yellow, 
G                   E
   watcha tryin' to prove? 
           D                        D
Cuz thatsa my woman there and I'm a man who cares 
         A                D
and this might be all for you"    (I said "excuse me!")

Verse 2:

      D                         D
I was scared and fearing for my life 
A                        A
shaking like a leaf on a tree 
           D                 D
Cuz he was lean and mean and big and bad, Lord, 
E                    A
pointing that gun at me 


        D                       D
I said "wait a minute mister, I didn't even kiss her, 
G                             E
   don't want no trouble with you 
      D                           D
and I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me 
A                  D
ask one favor from you: 


Chorus 1:
              D                        D
Say won't you gimme three steps, gimme three steps mister, 
A                            A
gimme three steps toward the door? 
D                        D
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps mister 
           A               D
and you'll never see me no more."

Verse 3:
             D                        D
Oh, well the crowd cleared away and I began to pray 
        A                 A
and the water fell on the floor 
        D                    D
and I'm telling you, son, it ain't no fun, 
        E                      A
staring straight down a fourty-four. 


         D                            D
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lou, 
               G                   E
and that's the break I was looking for 
              D                   D
and you could hear me screaming a mile away 
         A                     D
as I was headed out toward the door. 


Chorus 2:
              D                        D
Say won't you gimme three steps, gimme three steps mister, 
      A                      A
gimme three steps toward the door? 
D                        D
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps mister 
           A               D
and you'll never see me no more. (Fo' sho')
