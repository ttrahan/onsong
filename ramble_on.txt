Ramble On
Led Zeppelin
Key: E 
Tempo: 116 


[Verse 1]
[E]  [Esus2]  [E9sus4]  [A]  [Asus2]
The leaves are falling all around, time I was on my way
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go, the autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way

[Pre-Chorus]
[Emaj7]  [A/C#]  [B/D# add 7]  [A]  [F#m7]  [E]
Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

[Chorus]
[E]  [Esus2]  [E9sus4]  (scratch) [G]  [A]  [D]  [G] 
Ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on, gotta find the queen of all my dreams

[A]  [Gadd9]  [A]  x2


[Verse 2]
[E]  [Esus2]  [E9sus4]  [A]  [Asus2]
Got no time to for spreading roots
The time has come to be gone
And though "Our health" we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

[E]  [Esus2]  [E9sus4]  [A]  [Asus2]


[Chorus]
[E]  [Esus2]  [E9sus4]  (scratch) [G]  [A]  [D]  [G] 
Ramble on, and now the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on, I gotta find the queen of all my dreams

[A]  [Gadd9]  [A]  x2


[Bridge]
I tell you no lie


[Verse 3]
[E]  [Esus2]  [E9sus4]  [A]  [Asus2]
Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old, when magic filled the air
'Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her
Her, her, yeah


[Pre-Chorus]
[Emaj7]  [G#m7]  [F#m7]  [B/D# add 7]  [A]  [F#m7]  [E]
Ah, there's nothing I can do now
I guess I'll keep on

[Outro]
[E7]  [A7]  -> higher voicing  [E7]  [A7] [A7add6]
Ramblin', I'm gonna shake (Sing my song)
I gotta find my baby
I'm gonna ramble on, sing my song
Gonna work my way, going 'round the world
Baby, baby (Ramble on)
Do do do do do do do do, my baby
I can't stop this feeling in my heart
Every time I think about my baby I think "we gots to part"
Gotta keep on searching for my baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I gotta keep on searching for my baby
My, my, my, my, my, my, baby
I can't find my bluebird!
I listened to what my bluebird said, but I, I can't find my bluebird!
I keep rambling, baby
