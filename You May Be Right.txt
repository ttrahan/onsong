You May be Right
Billy Joel
Key: [A]

 
Intro:
[A]
(Lick x4)

Verse 1:
[A]Friday night I crashed your party,
Saturday I said I'm sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out a[E7]gain
I was o[Bm]nly having fun,
Wasn't hu[G]rting anyone
And we a[E]ll enjoyed the
Weekend for a ch[A]ange
(Lick x2)
 

Verse 2:
I've been s[A]tranded in the combat zone,
I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the r[E7]ain
And you t[Bm]old me not to drive,
But I m[G]ade it home alive
So you sa[E]id that only proves that I'm in[A]sane
 

Chorus:
You may be r[E]ight,
I may be cr[A]azy
Oh, but it j[E]ust may be a l[D]unatic
You're [F#m]looking for [A] 
Turn out the l[E]ights,
Don't try to s[A]ave me
You may be wr[D]ong for all I k[E]now,
But you may be rig[A]ht


Interlude:
[A]
(lick x4)
 

Verse 3:
Re[A]member how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you sm[E7]iled
You were l[Bm]onely for a man
I said "Ta[G]ke me as I am"
'Cause you mi[E]ght enjoy some madness for [A]awhile
(lick x2)
 

Verse 4:
Now [A]think of all the years you tried to 
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you s[E7]ay
If I'm c[Bm]razy then it's true
That it's a[G]ll because of you
And you w[E]ouldn't want me any other w[A]ay
 

Chorus:
You may be r[E]ight,
I may be cr[A]azy
Oh, but it j[E]ust may be a l[D]unatic
You're [F#m]looking for [A] 
It's too late to f[E]ight
It's too late to c[A]hange me
You may be wr[D]ong for all I k[E]now,
But you may be rig[A]ht
