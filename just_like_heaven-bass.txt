Verse 1:
Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick
The one that makes me scream, she said
The one that makes me laugh, she said
Threw her arms around my neck
Show me how you do it
And I'll promise you, I'll promise that 
I'll run away with you   
I'll run away with you   

Verse 2:
Spinning on that dizzy edge
I kissed her face, I kissed her neck
I dreamed of all the different ways
I had to make her glow
Why are you so far away
She said, why won't you ever know
That I'm in love with you    
That I'm in love with you   

Chorus 1:
You, soft and only
You, lost and only
You, strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest ocean
Twisting in the water
You're just like a dream    
(keys solo)
You're just like a dream   

Verse 3:
Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
And found myself alone, alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

Chorus 2:
You, soft and only
You, lost and only
You, just like heaven
