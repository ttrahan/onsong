Intro:

[A] 
(guitar only - 4 bars)


Verse 1:
(guitar plus kick only)
I got a little [A]change in my pocket 
Going jing a ling a ling
Want to call you on the telephone, baby
I'll give you a ring

But [D]each time we talk
I get the same old thing
Always no [A]huggy, no kissy
Until I get a wedding ring


Chorus 1:
My [E]honey, my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf
She said, don't [A]hand me no lines
And keep your hands to yourself


Post-chorus:
(all in)
[A]


Verse 2:
Ooh, baby, baby, baby
Why you treat me this way
You know I'm still your lover boy
I still feel the same way

That's when she told me a story
'Bout free milk and a cow
She said no huggy, no kissy
Until I get a wedding vow


Chorus 2:
My [E]honey, my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf
She said, don't [A]hand me no lines
And keep your hands to yourself


Solo 1:
[blues in A - 24 bars]


Verse 3:
You see, I wanted her real bad
And I was about to give in
And that's when she started talking 'bout true love
Started talking about sin

I said, honey, I'll live with you
For the rest of your life
She said, no huggy, no kissy
Until you make me your wife


Chorus 3:
My [E]honey, my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf
She said, don't [A]hand me no lines
And keep your hands to yourself


Solo 2:
[blues in A - 48 bars]
