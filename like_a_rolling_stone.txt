[Verse 1]
[C]Once upon a time you [Dm7]dressed so fine
You [Em]threw the bums a dime [F]in your prime, [G]   didn't you?
[C] People'd call, say, [Dm7]"Beware doll
you're [Em]bound to fall", but you [F]thought they were all [G]  kiddin' you
 
[F]  You used to  [G] laugh about
[F]  Everybody that was [G]hangin' out
[F] Now you [Em]don't [Dm7]talk so [C]loud
[F] Now you [Em]don't [Dm7]seem so [C]proud
 
About [Dm7]having to be [F]scrounging for your next [G]meal.
 
[Chorus 1]
How does it [C]feel  [F]  [G]
How does it [C]feel  [F]  [G]
To be without a [C]home  [F]  [G]
Like a complete un[C]known  [F]  [G]
Like a rolling [C]stone  [F]  [G]
 
[Instrumental]
[C]  [F]  [G]
 

[Verse 2]
Aww, You've [C]gone to the [Dm7]finest school all [Em]right, Miss Lonely
But you [F]know you only used to get [G]   juiced in it
No[C]body has ever taught you [Dm7]how to live on the [Em]street
And now you're [F]gonna have to get [G]   used to it
 
[F]  You said you'd never [G] compromise
[F]  With the mystery tramp, but now you [G] realize
 
[F] He's not [Em]selling any  a[Dm7]libis  [C]
[F] As you stare into the [Em]vacuum [Dm7]of his [C]eyes
 
And [Dm7]say do you want to [F]make a [G]deal?
 

[Chorus 2]
How does it [C]feel  [F]  [G]
How does it [C]feel  [F]  [G]
To be on your own your [C]own  [F]  [G]
With no direction [C]home  [F]  [G]
A complete un[C]known  [F]  [G]
Like a rolling [C]stone  [F]  [G]
 
 
[Instrumental]
[C]  [F]  [G]
 

[Verse 3]
Aww, You [C]never turned a[Dm7]round to see the [Em]frowns 
On the jugglers and the [F]clowns when they [G]all did tricks for you
You [C]never understood that it [Dm7]ain't no good
You [Em]shouldn't let other [F]people get your [G]   kicks for you
 
[F]  You used to ride on the chrome horse with [G] your diplomat
[F]  Who carried on his shoulder a [G]Siamese cat
 
[F] Ain't it hard [Em]  when you dis[Dm7]cover [C]that
[F] He really [Em]wasn't [Dm7] where it's at [C]
[Dm7]After he took from you [F] everything he could [G] steal
 
[Chorus 3]
How does it [C]feel  [F]  [G]
How does it [C]feel  [F]  [G]
To have you own your [C]own  [F]  [G]
With no direction [C]home  [F]  [G]
A complete un[C]known  [F]  [G]
Like a rolling [C]stone  [F]  [G]


[Instrumental]
[C]  [F]  [G]
 

[Verse 4]
Aww,[C] Princess on the [Dm7]steeple and all the pretty [Em] people
They're all [F]drinkin', thinkin' that they [G]   got it made
[C] Exchanging all pre[Dm7]cious gifts  [Em]
But you'd better [F]take your diamond ring,[G] you'd better pawn it babe
 
[F]  You used to be [G] so amused
[F]  At Napoleon in rags [G] and the language that he used
 
[F] Go to him now, he [Em]calls you, you [Dm7]can't refuse  [C]
[F] When you got [Em]nothing, you got [Dm7]nothing to lose  [C]
You're [Dm7]invisible now, you got no [F] secrets to con[G]ceal.
 
[Chorus 4]
How does it [C]feel  [F]  [G]
How does it [C]feel  [F]  [G]
To be on your [C]own  [F]  [G]
With no direction [C]home  [F]  [G]
A complete un[C]known  [F]  [G]
Like a rolling [C]stone  [F]  [G]

 
[Instrumental]
[C]  [F]  [G]
