[Verse]
C                    Dm7
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
    Em                    F            G
You threw the bums a dime in your prime,   didn't you?
C                      Dm7
  People'd call, say, "Beware doll, 
       Em                         F             G
you're bound to fall" You thought they were all   kiddin' you
 
F             G
  You used to   laugh about
F                    G
  Everybody that was   hangin' out
 
F         Em   Dm7         C
 Now you don't talk so loud
F         Em   Dm7          C
 Now you don't seem so proud
 
     Dm7                     F              G
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
 
[Chorus]
                C  F  G
How does it feel
                C  F  G
How does it feel
                    C  F  G
To be without a home
                       C  F  G
Like a complete unknown
                     C  F  G
Like a rolling stone

[Verse]
           C            Dm7                   Em
Aww, You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
        F                         G
But you know you only used to get   juiced in it
  C                        Dm7                Em
Nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
               F                 G
And now you're gonna have to get   used to it
 
F                    G
  You said you'd never  compromise
F                                    G
  With the mystery tramp, but now you  realize
 
F         Em         Dm7     C
 He's not selling any  alibis
F                      Em      Dm7       C
 As you stare into the vacuum  of his eyes
 
    Dm7               F        G
And say do you want to  make a deal?
 
[Chorus]
                C  F  G
How does it feel
                C  F  G
How does it feel
                 C  F  G
To be on your own
                      C  F  G
With no direction home
                  C  F  G
A complete unknown
                    C  F  G
Like a rolling stone

[Verse]
        C              Dm7                    Em
Aww, You never turned around to see the frowns 
                        F                        G
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did   tricks for you
    C                        Dm7
You never understood that it ain't no good
    Em                  F               G
You shouldn't let other people get your   kicks for you
 
F                                                G
  You used to ride on the chrome horse with your   diplomat
F                               G
  Who carried on his shoulder a   Siamese cat
 
F             Em            Dm7      C
 Ain't it hard  when you discover that
F          Em      Dm7         C
 He really wasn't  where it's at
     Dm7                         F          G
After he took from you everything  he could steal.
 
[Chorus]
                C  F  G
How does it feel
                C  F  G
How does it feel
                       C  F  G
To have you on your own
                      C  F  G
With no direction home
                      C  F  G
Like a complete unknown
                    C  F  G
Like a rolling stone

   C                 Dm7                 Em
Aww, Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
            F                            G
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they   got it made
C                Dm7          Em
 Exchanging all precious gifts
                 F                      G
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe
 
F               G
  You used to be so amused
F                    G
  At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
 
F                  Em             Dm7         C
 Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
F             Em              Dm7            C
 When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose
       Dm7                       F           G
 You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
 
[Chorus]
                C  F  G
How does it feel
                C  F  G
How does it feel
                 C  F  G
To be on your own
                      C  F  G
With no direction home
                      C  F  G
Like a complete unknown
                    C  F  G
Like a rolling stone
