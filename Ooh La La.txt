Verse 1:
 D                 Em7                       
Poor old Granddad  I laughed at all his words
 D                              Em7                     
I thought he was a bitter man   He spoke of women's ways
 D                                   Em7                  
They'll trap you, then they use you  Be-fore you even know
 D                                          Em7                   
For love is blind and you're far too kind   Don't ever let it show

Chorus:
 D                            Em7   G                 
I wish that I knew all I know now   When I was younger
 D                             Em7  G                   
I wish that I knew all I know now   When I was stronger.

Verse 2:
 D                                 Em7                          
The Can Can's such a pretty show   They'll steal your heart away
 D                                   Em7                        
But backstage, back on earth again   The dressing rooms are grey
 D                                          Em7                            
They come on strong and it ain't too long   Before they make you feel a man
 D                                         Em7                    
But love is blind and you soon will find   You're just a boy again

Verse 3:
 D                                        Em7                           
When you want her lips, you get a cheek   Makes you wonder where you are
 D                                            Em7                                 
If you want some more and she's fast asleep   Leaves you twinkling with the stars.
 D                           Em7              
Poor young grandson, there's nothing I can say
 D                                  Em7                       
You'll have to learn, just like me  And that's the hardest way
