The Who

Esus4

Verse:
Em                     G               D       Dsus4-D
No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man 
          Cadd9     Asus2         
To be the sad man behind blue eyes
Em                     G          D     Dsus4-D
No one knows what it's like to be hated 
      Cadd9            Asus2    
To be fated to telling only lies

Chorus:
       C  D                  G     Gadd9-G
But my dreams they aren't as empty 
      C          D        E  E13-E
As my conscience seems to be 
       Bm          C     
I have hours, only lonely
           D         Dsus4-D      Asus2
My love is vengeance that's never free

Verse 2:
Em                     G                  D        Dsus4-D
No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings 
       Cadd9             Asus2
Like I do... and I blame you
Em                   G             D     Dsus4-D
No one bites back as hard on their anger 
        Cadd9                       Asus2  
None of my pain and woe... can show through

Chorus:
       C  D                  G     Gadd9-G
But my dreams they aren't as empty 
      C          D        E  E13-E
As my conscience seems to be 
       Bm          C     
I have hours, only lonely
           D         Dsus4-D      Asus2
My love is vengeance that's never free

E            Bm       A        E   
When my fist clenches crack it open
          Bm         G       D   
Before  I use it and lose my cool
       Bm    A            D       
When I smile,tell me some bad news
         Bm        A          E   
Before I laugh and act like a fool

E        Bm      A        E   
And if I swallow anything evil
         Bm     A       D     
Put your finger down my throat
     Bm     A                D      
If I shiver please give me a blanket
        Bm           A         E   
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

          Cadd9    Asus2           
To be the sad man, behind blue eyes
