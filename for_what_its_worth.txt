Buffalo Springfield

[Intro]

E A 2x

[Verse]

        E                   A
There's somethin' happenin' here
        E                A
What it is ain't exactly clear
          E                    A
There's a man with a gun, over there
        E             A
Tellin' me I got to beware

[Chorus]  
            
(I think it's time we)
E               D
Stop, children, what's that sound?
A                             E
Everybody look - what's goin' down?

E A 2x

[Verse]

        E                  A
There's battle lines bein' drawn
         E                    A
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
             E              A
Young people speakin' their minds
        E                  A
Gettin' so much resistance from behind

[Chorus]

(I think it's time we)
E               D
Stop, children, what's that sound?
A                             E
Everybody look - what's goin' down?

E A 2x

[Verse]

E                        A
What a field day for the heat
  E                      A
A thousand people in the street
        E                  A
Singin' songs and carryin' signs
       E                       A
Mostly sayin', "hooray for our side"

[Chorus]

(It's time we..)
E               D
Stop, children, what's that sound?
A                             E
Everybody look - what's goin' down?

[Interlude]

E A  2x

[Bridge]

E                A
Paranoia strikes deep
E                      A
Into your life it will creep
   E                          A
It starts when you're always afraid
            E                      A
Step out of line, the man come and take you away

[Chorus]

(I think it's time we)
E               D
Stop, children, what's that sound?
A                             E
Everybody look - what's goin' down?
(I think it's time we)
E               D
Stop, children, what's that sound?
A                             E
Everybody look - what's goin' down?
(I think it's time we)
E               D
Stop, children, what's that sound?
A                             E
Everybody look - what's goin' down?
(I think it's time we)
E               D
Stop, children, what's that sound?
A                             E
Everybody look - what's goin' down?
