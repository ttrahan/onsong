Verse 1:
[Bb] [C]               [F]
         You're always dancing down the street
[Bb]        [C]        [F]
  With your suede blue eyes
[Bb] [C]       [F]
         Every new boy that you meet
[Bb] [C]          [F]             [Bb] [C]
     Doesn't know real surprise        (here she comes again)
 
 
Chorus 1:
[F]            [Bb]               [C]
    When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky oh
[F]                 [Bb]   [C]
    She'll make you flip   (here she comes again)
[F]           [Bb]                 [C]
    When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
[F]      [Bb]             [C]
    I kinda like the way she dips
[Bb] [C]                       [Bb]
        She's my best friend's girl
[C]                            [Bb]
        She's my best friend's girl
[C]
        But she used to be mine

         And your drip dry glove
[Bb] [C]              [F]
         And when you bite your lip
[Bb]         [C]             [F]        [Bb]     [C]
