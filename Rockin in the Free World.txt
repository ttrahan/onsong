Verse 1:
[Em]                          [D][C]
   There’s colors on the street
Em]                          [D][C]              
   Red, white, and blue
Em]                          [D][C]
   People shuffling their feet
Em]                          [D][C]
   People sleeping in their shoes
 
[Em]                             [D]  [C]
There’s a warning sign on the road ahead
[Em]                             [D]  [C]
There’s a lot of people saying we’d be better off dead
[Em]                             [D]  [C]
Don’t feel like Satan, but I am to them
 [Em]                             [D]  [C]
So I try to forget it any way I can

Verse 2:
[Em]                          [D][C]
I see a woman in the night
[Em]                          [D][C]
With a baby in her hand
[Em]                          [D][C]
There's an old street light
[Em]                          [D][C]
Near a garbage can
 
[Em]                             [D]  [C]
Now she put the kid away and she’s gone to get a hit
[Em]                             [D]  [C]
She hates her life and what she’s done to it
[Em]                             [D]  [C]
There’s one more kid that’ll never go to school
[Em]                             [D]  [C]
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool

Keep on rockin' in the free world

Keep on rockin' in the free world

[Em]                          [D][C]
We got a thousand points of light
[Em]                          [D][C]
For the homeless man
[Em]                          [D][C]
We got a kinder, gentler machine gun hand
 
[Em]                             [D]  [C]
We've got department stores and toilet paper
[Em]                             [D]  [C]
Got styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer
[Em]                             [D]  [C]
Got a man of the people says keep hope alive

Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive
