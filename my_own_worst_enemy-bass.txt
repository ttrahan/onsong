VERSE 1:
Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk,
I didn't mean to call you that. 
I can't remember what was said or what you threw at me
Please tell me, please tell me

CHORUS 1:
Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
My car is in the front yard, and I'm, sleeping with my clothes on,
I came in through the window, last night,
and you're, gone,   gone.

RIFF:

VERSE 2:
It's no surprise to me I am my own worst enemy,
'Cause every now and then I kick the living shit out of me
The smoke alarm is going off and there's a cigarette,
Still burning, please tell me 

CHORUS 2:
whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
My car is in the front yard, and I'm, sleeping with my clothes on,
I came in through the window, last night,
and you're, gone,   gone.

SOLO:
Please tell me 

CHORUS 3:
Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
My car is in the front yard, and I'm, sleeping with my clothes on,
I came in through the window, last night

OUTRO:
It's no surprise to me I am my own worst enemy (ah oooooooh)
'Cause every now and then I kick the living shit out of me (ah oooooooh)
