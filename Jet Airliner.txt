VERSE 1:
  A            D          A
Leavin' home, out on the road
 D                A
I've been down before

Ridin' along in this big ol' jet plane
            D                A
I've been thinkin' about my home

But my love light seems so far away
       G             D        A
And I feel like it's all been done

Somebody's tryin' to make me stay
               G       D      A
You know I've got to be movin' on


CHORUS 1:
       G       D      A
Oh, Oh big ol' jet airliner
 G             D        A
Don't carry me too far away
        G      D      A
Oh, Oh big ol' jet airliner
            G             D      A
Cause it's here that I've got to stay

(Riff x4)

VERSE 2:
 A                  D         A
Goodbye to all my friends at home
     D                   A
Goodbye to people I've trusted

I've got to go out and make my way
        D                              A
I might get rich you know I might get busted

But my heart keeps calling me backwards
      G         D       A
As I get on the Seven-O-Seven

Ridin' high I got tears in my eyes
             G                 D
You know you got to go through hell
           A
Before you get to heaven


CHORUS 2:
G       D      A
Big ol' jet airliner
 G             D        A
Don't carry me too far away
        G      D      A
Oh, Oh big ol' jet airliner
            G             D      A
Cause it's here that I've got to stay

(Riff x4)

VERSE 3:
 A                    D       A
Touchin' down in New England town
 D                    A
Feel the heat comin' down

I've got to keep on keepin' on
              D                  A
You know the big wheel keeps on spinnin' around

And I'm goin' with some hesitation
              G     D      A
You know that I can surely see

That I don't want to get caught up in any of that
G     D          A
Funky shit goin' down in the city


CHORUS 3:
G       D      A
Big ol' jet airliner
 G             D        A
Don't carry me too far away
        G      D      A
Oh, Oh big ol' jet airliner
            G             D      A
Cause it's here that I've got to stay

Oh, Oh big ol' jet airliner
            G             D      A
Cause it's here that I've got to stay

 A
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

Big ol' jet airliner
 G             D        A
Don't carry me too far away
        G      D      A
Oh, Oh big ol' jet airliner
            G             D      A
Cause it's here that I've got to stay


CHORUS 6:
       G       D      A
Oh, Oh big ol' jet airliner
 G      D      A
Carry me to my home

Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
