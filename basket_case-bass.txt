Verse 1:
(vocals + guitar 1 only)

Do you have the time, to listen to me whine
About nothing and everything, all at once

I am one of those, melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

Chorus 1:
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up, (all in) I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid

Riff 1:
Or am I just stoned

Verse 2:
I went to a shrink, to analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex, that's bringing me down

I went to a whore, he said my life's a bore
So quit my whining cuz, it's bringing her down

Chorus 2:

Riff 2:
Uh, yuh, yuh, yuh

Bridge:
Grasping to control, so I better hold on

Chorus 3:

Outro:
Or am I just stoned
