Theres a port on a western bay
       F#m   A          D/F#    A  
And it serves a hundred ships a day
       E      Abm       F#m  Abm  C#m
Lonely sailors pass the time a    way
    F#m   A          E    
And talk about their homes

Theres a girl in this harbor town
And she works laying whiskey down
They say Brandy, fetch another round
She serves them whisky and wine
The sailors say...

Chorus: Brandy, you're a fine girl < you're a fine girl >
B      C#m7          B     A                      
What a good wife you would be < such a fine girl >
Bsus4                  B                   
Your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea

Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the north of spain
A locket that bears the name of the man that Brandy loves
He came on a summers day - bearing gifts - from far away
But he made it clear he couldnt stay
No harbor was his home

- Chorus -

        C#m7           B             
Bridge: Brandy used to watch his eyes
      A               B      
As he told his sailor stories
          C#m7           B            
She could feel the ocean fall and rise
    A              B    
She saw its raging glory
    C#m7          D             
But he had always told the truth
        C#m7          A  
Lord he was an honest man
    Bsus4          B                  
And Brandy does her best to understand

At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a slient town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say
She hears him say...
