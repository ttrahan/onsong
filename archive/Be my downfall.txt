Verse 1:
G                  C  
The bus is pulling out
                       G 
And I guess I'd better go
  Am            C                                 D   
Before I make a grave mistake and let my feelings show
    G             C  
And twenty miles away
                    G 
She waits alone for me
    Am            C                             D  
But when I try to picture her, you're the one I see

Chorus:
        C          G             Am7/G
And in another situation I could 
         C    
Put up a fight
    Am             D          G     
But you will be my downfall tonight?

Verse 2:
G                      C   
So the night is coming down
               G   
Drowning us in blue
    Am              C                                    D 
And it all points toward the things we know we shouldn't do
    G            C  
And as I look at you
                      G    
And I fall under your spell
       Am               C                                  D   
Well I know I should be thinking of her, lying there by herself

Chorus:
         C              G                 
And when faced with temptation you know...
             Am7/G     C    
A man should stand and fight
    Am             D          G    
But you will be my downfall tonight

Be the one girl, that I'll never forget

Be my undoing, be my slow road to ruin, tonight

So the bus is pulling out
                           G  
And I'm grounded here with you
      Am              C                                    D 
And I want to say the sweet things babe I've always wanted to
   C               G               
So tell me now the tail lights have
Am7/G       C    
Gone out of sight
Am              D         Am7/G        G    
Wonâ€™t you be my downfall, once again tonight
G - Csingle strum
