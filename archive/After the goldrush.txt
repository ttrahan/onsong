Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armour coming
       C                 F    
Saying something about a queen
            C                    G                
There where peasants singing and drummers drumming

And the archer split the tree

Look at mother nature on the run

      C                     F       
I was lying in a burned out basement
       C               F  
With a full moon in my eye
      C            G        
I was hoping for replacement
         F                     G  
When the sun burst through the sky

            Am           Bb        
There was a band playing in my head
      F                 Bb  
And I felt like getting high
      C                     G              
I was thinking about what a friend had said
      Bb              F  
I was hoping it was a lie
C                   G              
Thinking about what friend had said

I was hoping it was a lie

Verse 3:
       C                        F               
Well I dreamed I saw the silver spaceship flying
       C                  F  
In the yellow haze of the sun
           C                   G             
There were children crying and colours flying
     F                G  
All around the chosen one

Chorus:
         Am         Bb        
All in a dream, all in a dream
    F             Bb 
The loading had begun
C                      G          
Flying mother nature's silver seed
     Bb              F  
To a new home in the sun
C                      G          
Flying mother nature's silver seed
     Bb       F
To a new home
