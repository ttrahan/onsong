A hard rain's a-gonna fall
Bob Dylan
Key: G

Verse 1:
G                                    
Where have you been my blue-eyed son?
                                      D   
Where have you been, my darling young one?

Pre-chorus:
     C                      G                     
I've strayed on the side of twelve misty mountains
     C                          G                   
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
     C                        G                
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
          C                 G                
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
     C                         G                   
Been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard

Chorus:
G              D     G     C   
And it's hard, hard, hard, hard
       G    D              C    G
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall 

Verse 2:
G                                  
What did you see, my blue-eyed son?
                                   D   
What did you see, my darling young one?

Pre-chorus:
        C                     G                    
I saw a newborn babe with the wild wolves around it
        C                      G           
I saw a highway of golden with nobody on it
        C                   G                       
I saw a black branch with a blood that kept dripping
      C                           G                 
Saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding
        C                G                 
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
    C                          G                    
Saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were a-broken
    C                            G                      
Saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children

Chorus:
G              D     G     C   
And it's hard, hard, hard, hard
       G    D              C    G
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall 

Verse 3:
G                                   
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
                                    D   
What did you hear, my darling young one?

Pre-chorus:
            C                     G                   
I heard the roar of a thunder, it roared out a warning
          C                         G                    
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
          C                      G                   
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing
      C                           G               
Heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening
          C                  G                 
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
          C                     G                 
Heard the sound of a clown that cried in the alley
          C                       G                 
Heard the sound of one person who cried he was human

Chorus:
G              D     G     C   
And it's hard, hard, hard, hard
       G    D              C    G
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall 

Verse 4:
G                                  
Who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
                                   D   
Who did you meet, my darling young one?

Pre-chorus:
  C                   G               
I met a young child beside a dead pony
  C                   G                 
I met a white man who walked a black dog
  C                       G               
I met a young women whose body was burning
  C                     G                
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
  C                   G              
I met one man, he was wounded in love
  C                       G                
I met another man, he was wounded in hatred

Chorus:
G              D     G     C   
And it's hard, hard, hard, hard
       G    D              C    G
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall 

Verse 5:
G                                         
Well what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
                                     D   
What'll you do now, my darling young one?

Pre-chorus:
    C                         G                    
I'm going back out, 'fore the rain starts a-falling
     C                         G                  
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
          C                         G                  
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
          C                     G                 
Where the pellets of poison are flooding my waters
          C                            G                
Where the home in the valley meets the dark dirty prison
             C                  G                 
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden
      C                     G                  
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
      C                         G                 
Where black is the color, where none is the number
         C                      G                 
And I'll see it and tell it and think it and be it
       C                          G                   
And reflect from the mountains so all souls can see it
         C                    G                  
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking
         C                   G                   
But I'll know my song well before I start singing

Chorus:
G              D     G     C   
And it's hard, hard, hard, hard
       G    D              C    G
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
