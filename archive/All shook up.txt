All shook up
Elvis Presley
Key: G

Verse 1:
     G                                 
Well bless my soul what's wrong with me
    G                                 
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
   G                                   
My friends say I'm acting wild as a bug

Chorus:
       G - n.c.  G           
I'm in love, I'm all shook up
      C   D       G  
Mm mm mm, mm, yay yay

Verse 2:
        G                                    
Well my hands are shaky and my knees are weak
  G                                     
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
    G                                       
Who do you think of when you have such luck?

Chorus:
       G - n.c.  G           
I'm in love, I'm all shook up
      C   D       G  
Mm mm mm, mm, yay yay

Bridge:
     C                                    
Well please don't ask me what's on my mind
      G                                   
I'm a little mixed up but I'm feeling fine
         C                              
When I'm near that girl that I love best
   D                 D7                
My heart beats so it scares me to death

Verse 3:
         G                                 
Well she touched my hand what a chill I got
    G                                    
Her lips are like a volcano when it's hot
    G                                   
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup

Chorus:
       G - n.c.  G           
I'm in love, I'm all shook up
      C   D        G  
Mm mm mm, mm, yay, yay

Bridge:
   C                                   
My tongue gets tied when I try to speak
   G                                  
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree
        C                                  
There's only one cure for this body of mine
          D                     D7          
That's to have that girl that I love so fine

Verse 4:
         G                                 
Well she touched my hand what a chill I got
    G                                    
Her lips are like a volcano when it's hot
    G                                   
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup

Chorus:
       G - n.c.  G           
I'm in love, I'm all shook up
      C   D        G  
Mm mm mm, mm, yay, yay

End:
G - n.c.    
All shook up
