It is the evening of the day 
C         D7                 F    G7
I sit and watch the children play 

Chorus:
F             G7       
Smiling faces I can see
C           Am

I sit and watch as tears go by

My riches can't buy everything

I want to hear the children sing 

Chorus:
F                 G7           
All I hear is the sound of rain
C              Am    
Falling on the ground
F                           G7
I sit and watch as tears go by

Chorus:
F              G7        
Doing things I used to do
C              Am 
They think are new
F                           G7
I sit and watch as tears go by
