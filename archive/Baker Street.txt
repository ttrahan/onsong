Verse 1:
B                                    
Winding your way down on Baker Street
B                                       
Light in your head and dead on your feet
      F#m                   A                   
Well another crazy day, you drink the night away
       E              Esus2-D*               (*throughout)
And forget about everything                  

Verse 2:
B                                      
This city desert makes you feel so cold
B                                           
It's got so many people but it's got no soul
         F#m                  A                      
And it's taken you so long to find out you were wrong
         E                         
When you thought it held everything

Chorus:
Em7                           Bm7F#m7*-Am7    (*lift off 2nd string)
You used to think that it was so easy         
Em7                         Bm7    
You used to say that it was so easy
    D              A             E  
But you're trying, you're trying now
Em7                         Bm7     
Another year and then you'd be happy
Em7                               Bm7     
Just one more year and then you'd be happy
    D              A             B  
But you're crying, you're crying now

Verse 3:
B                                               
Way down the street there's a light in his place
B                                                
He opens the door, he's got that look on his face
       F#m                       
And he asks you where you've been
    A                       
You tell him who you've seen
        E                  
And you talk about anything

Verse 4:
B                                         
He's got this dream about buying some land
B                                                    
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
    F#m                             A                
And then he'll settle down, in some quiet little town
       E                   
And forget about everything

Chorus:
Em7                       Bm7        
But you know he'll always keep moving
Em7                       Bm7        
You know he's never gonna stop moving
    D             A                E    
Cos he's rolling, he's the rolling stone
Em7                          Bm7        
When when you wake up it's a new morning
Em7                        Bm7        
The sun is shining, it's a new morning
D             A            B   
You're going, you're going home

End:
G-D   F-F-D   F-F-C   Am7   G
