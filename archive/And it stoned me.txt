Verse 1:
G                    D                   C                 G   
Half a mile from the county fair and the rain came pouring down
G            D                     C             G    
Me and Billy standing there with a silver half a crown
G                 D                    C             G    
Hands are full of fishing rods and the tackle on our backs
G                   D                     C                 G    
We just stood there getting wet, with our backs against the fence

Pre-chorus:
Am      D    
Oh, the water
Am      D    
Oh, the water
Am      D     Em                           d-a-d-ad-a-d-a
Oh, the water and I hope it don't rain all day 

Chorus:
       G         C          G
And it stoned me to my soul 
                    D                 Em     G 
Stoned me just like jelly roll and it stoned me
                 C          G
And it stoned me to my soul 
               D                 Em     G 
Stoned me just going home and it stoned me

Verse 2:
                             D                C               G  
And the rain let up, and the sun came up, and we were getting dry
              D              C                G 
Almost glad a pick-up truck, nearly passed us by
                              D                     C                 G   
So we jumped right in and the driver grinned and he dropped us up the road
                               D                       C               G    
Yeh, we looked at the swim, we jumped right in, not to mention fishing poles

Pre-chorus:
Am      D    
Oh, the water
Am      D    
Oh, the water
Am      D      Em                  d-a-d-ad-a-d-a
Oh, the water, let it run all over me 

Chorus:
   G         C          G
It stoned me to my soul 
                    D                 Em     G 
Stoned me just like jelly roll and it stoned me
                 C          G
And it stoned me to my soul 
               D                 Em     G 
Stoned me just going home and it stoned me

Verse 3:
G                       D                    C                    G  
On the way back home we sang a song, but our throats were getting dry
                         D                        C               G   
Then we saw the man from across the road with the sunshine in his eyes
                               D                      C                G  
Well he lived all alone in his own little home with a great big gallon jar
                                D                  C                   G   
There were bottles too, one for me and you, and he said "Hey there you are"

Pre-chorus:
Am      D    
Oh, the water
Am      D    
Oh, the water
Am      D     Em                              d-d D  d-d D
Oh, the water get it myself from the mountain stream 

Chorus:
   G         C          G
It stoned me to my soul 
                    D                 Em     G 
Stoned me just like jelly roll and it stoned me
                 C          G
And it stoned me to my soul 
               D                 Em     G 
Stoned me just going home and it stoned me

End:
        G         C          G
Well it stoned me to my soul 
                    D                 Em     G 
Stoned me just like jelly roll and it stoned me
                 C          G
And it stoned me to my soul 
               D                 Em     G 
Stoned me just going home and it stoned me
