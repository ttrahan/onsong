Intro:
[A]  [Bb]  [Bm]  [E]


Verse 1:
         A                  Bbdim7
Blame it all on my roots, I showed up in boots
    Bm
And ruined your black tie affair
    E                     E7
The last one to know, the last one to show
          A
I was the last one you thought you'd see there


      A                         Bbdim7
And I saw the surprise, and the fear in his eyes
     Bm                      Dm7
When I took his glass of champagne
E                   E7
I toasted you, said honey we may be through
    E                    E7
But you'll never hear me complain


Chorus 1:
       A
'Cause I got friends in low places
          A
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
    Bm             E
My blues away, and I'll be okay


A
I'm not big on social graces
           A                    A7
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
       Bm              E
'Cause I've got friends 
        A
In low places


Solo 1:


Verse 2:
       A                    Bbdim7
Well I guess I was wrong, I just don't belong
    Bm
But then, I've been there before
     E                     E7
Everything's alright, I'll just say goodnight
         A
And I'll show myself to the door


    A                 Bbdim7
Hey I didn't mean to cause a big scene
     Bm                  Dm7
Just give me an hour and then
E                       E7
I'll be as high as that ivory tower
E                   E7
 That you're livin' in 


Chorus 2:
       A
'Cause I got friends in low places
          A
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
    Bm             E
My blues away, and I'll be okay


A
I'm not big on social graces
           A                    A7
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
       Bm              E
'Cause I've got friends 
        A
In low places


Verse 3:
         A                  Bbdim7
Well I guess I was wrong, I just don't belong
    Bm
But then, I've been there before
    E                     E7
And everything is alright, I'll just say goodnight
          A
And I'll show myself to the door


      A                         Bbdim7
Hey I didn't mean to cause a big scene
     Bm                      Dm7
Just wait 'til I've finished this glass
E                   E7
Then sweet little lady, I'll head back to the bar
    E                    E7
And you can kiss my ass!
