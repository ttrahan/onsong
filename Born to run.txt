Intro:
EEsus4E       A     B
                 
EEsus4E       A     B
                 
Verse 1:
E                                        
In the day we sweat it out on the streets
     A                B    
Of a runaway American dream
   E                                      
At night we ride through mansions of glory
   A         B     
In suicide machines

Chorus:
A                        A/G#     
Sprung from cages out on highway 9
       A/F#                       A/G#                  E   D6
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected and stepping out over the line
A                       A/G#                
Baby this town rips the bones from your back
       A/F#               A/G#       
It’s a death trap, it's a suicide rap
         E                  C#m  
We gotta get out while were young
    A               B                    E  
Cos tramps like us, baby we were born to run

Verse 2:
      E                                
Wendy let me in, I wanna be your friend
          A                     B      
I want to guard your dreams and visions
     E                                      
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
    A                          B      
And strap your hands across my engines

Chorus:
A                 A/G#           
Together we could break this trap
     A/F#              A/G#               E    D6
Well run till we drop, baby well never go back 
         A                A/G#       
Will you walk with me out on the wire
    A/F#                       A/G#        
Cos baby I’m just a scared and lonely rider
            E               C#m  
But I gotta find out how it feels
         A                            B                       E   
I want-a know if love is wild, girl I want to know if love is real

Bridge:
Dsus4      D       Dsus4        D     
Beyond the palace, hemi-powered drones
       Gsus4         G   
Scream down the boulevard
          Asus4      A       Asus4     A      
The girls comb their hair in rear view mirrors
        Csus4       C       Csus4  C
And the boys try to look so hard   
    Dsus4     D          Dsus4    D    
The amusement park rises bold and stark
         Gsus4          G          Gsus4G
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist 
        Asus4        A            Asus4     A    
I wanna die with you Wendy on the streets tonight
      Csus4C       Csus4C
In an everlasting kiss

Verse 3:
E                                     
The highways jammed with broken heroes
     A                 B    
On a last chance power drive
E                                 
Everybody’s out on the run tonight
            A                B   
But there's no place left to hide

Chorus:
A                     A/G#                 
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness
     A/F#                  A/G#          E    D6
I’ll love you with all the madness in my soul 
A               A/G#           
Someday girl, I don't know when
            A/F#             
We’re gonna get to that place
         A/G#           E                       C#m
Where we really want to go and well walk in the sun
              A               B                    E   C#m
But till then tramps like us, baby we were born to run 

End:

But till then tramps like us, baby we were born to run 
A               B                    E  
Tramps like us, baby we were born to run
